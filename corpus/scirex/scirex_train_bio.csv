10,Natural language inference ( NLI ) is an important and significant task in natural language processing ( NLP ) .,"B,I,I,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O"
11,"It concerns whether a hypothesis can be inferred from a premise , requiring understanding of the semantic similarity between the hypothesis and the premise to discriminate their relation .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
12,Table [ reference ] shows several samples of natural language inference from SNLI ( Stanford Natural Language Inference ) corpus .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
13,"In the literature , the task of NLI is usually viewed as a relation classification .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14,"It learns the relation between a premise and a hypothesis in a large training set , then predicts the relation between a new pair of premise and hypothesis .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15,The existing methods of NLI can be roughly partitioned into two categories : feature - based models and neural network - based models .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
16,"Feature - based models represent a premise and a hypothesis by their unlexicalized and lexicalized features , such as - gram length and the real - valued feature of length difference , then train a classifier to perform relation classification .","B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O"
17,"Recently , end - to - end neural network - based models have drawn worldwide attention since they have demonstrated excellent performance on quite a few NLP tasks including machine translation , natural language inference , etc .","O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,O,O,O"
18,"On the basis of their model structures , we can divide neural network - based models for NLI into two classes , sentence encoding models and sentence interaction - aggregation models .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
19,The architectures of the two types of models are shown in Figure [ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
20,"Sentence encoding models ( their main architecture is shown in Figure [ reference ] .a ) independently encode a pair of sentences , a premise and a hypothesis using pre - trained word embedding vectors , then learn semantic relation between two sentences with a multi - layer perceptron ( MLP ) .","B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O"
21,"In these models , LSTM ( Long Short - Term Memory networks ) , its variants GRU ( Gated Recurrent Units ) and Bi - LSTM , are usually utilized to encode the sentences since they were capable of learning long - term dependencies inside sentences .","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
22,"For example , Conneau et al . proposed a generic NLI training scheme and compared several sentence encoding architectures : LSTM or GRU , Bi - LSTM with mean / max pooling , self - attention network and hierarchical convolutional networks .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,O"
23,The experimental results demonstrated that the Bi - LSTM with max pooling achieved the best performance .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
24,Talman et al . designed a hierarchical Bi - LSTM max pooling ( HBMP ) model to encode sentences .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O"
25,"This model applied parameters of one Bi - LSTM to initialize the next Bi - LSTM to convey information , which shown better results than the model with a single Bi - LSTM .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
26,"Besides LSTM , attention mechanisms could also be used to boost the effectiveness of sentence encoding .","O,B,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
27,"The model developed by Ghaeini et al . added self - attention to LSTM model , and achieved better performance .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
28,"Sentence interaction - aggregation models ( their main architecture is shown in Figure [ reference ] .b ) learn vector representations of pairs of sentences in the way similar to sentence encoding models and calculate pairwise word interaction matrix between two sentences using the newly updated word vectors , and then the matching results are aggregated into a vector to make the final decision .","B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
29,"Compared with sentence encoding model , sentence interaction - aggregation models aggregate word similarities between a pair of sentences , are capable of capturing the relevant information between two sentences , a premise and a hypothesis .","O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
30,"Bahdanau et al . translated and aligned text simultaneously in machine translation task , innovatively introducing attention mechanism to natural language process ( NLP ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O"
31,"He et al . designed a pairwise word interaction model ( PWIM ) , which made full use of word - level fine - grained information .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
32,"Wang et al . put forward a bilateral multi - perspective matching ( BiMPM ) model , focusing on various matching strategies that could be seen as different types of attention .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
33,"The empirical studies of Lan et al . and Chen et al . concluded that sentence interation - aggregation models , especially ESIM ( Enhanced Sequential Inference Model ) , a carefully designed sequential inference model based on chain LSTMs , outperformed all previous sentence encoding models .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
34,"Although ESIM has achieved excellent achievements , this model does n’t consider the attention along the words in a sentence in its Bi - LSTM layer .","O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
35,Word attention can characterize the different contribution of each word .,"B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
36,"Therefore , it will be beneficial to put word attention into the Bi - LTSM layer .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
37,"Moreover , the orientation of the words represents the direction of the information flow , either forward or backward , should not be ignored .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
38,"In traditional Bi - LSTM model , the forward and the backward vectors learnt by Bi - LSTM are simply jointed .","O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O"
39,"It ’s necessary to consider whether each orientation ( forward or backward ) has different importance on word encoding , thus adaptively joint the two orientation vectors together with different weights .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
40,"Therefore , in this study , using ESIM model as the baseline , we add an attention layer behind each Bi - LSTM layer , then use an adaptive orientation embedding layer to jointly represent the forward and backward vectors .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

42,"Experimental results on SNLI , MultiNLI and Quora benchmarks have demonstrated better performance of aESIM model than that of the baseline ESIM and the other state - of - the - art models .","O,O,O,B,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
43,"We believe that the architecture of Bi - aLSTM has potentially to be used in other NLP tasks such as text classification , machine translation and so on .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O,O,O,O"
44,This paper is organized as follows .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
45,We introduce the general frameworks of ESIM and aESIM in Section 2 .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O"

48,section : Attention Boosted Sequential Inference Model,"O,O,B,I,I,I,I"
49,"Supposed that we have two sentences and , where represents premise and represents hypothesis .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
50,The goal is to predict the label meaning for their relation .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
51,subsection : ESIM model,"O,O,B,I"
52,"Enhanced Sequential Inference Model ( ESIM ) is composed of four main components : input encoding layer , local inference modeling layer , inference composition layer and classification layer .","B,I,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,O"
53,"In the input encoding layer , ESIM first uses Bi - LSTM layer to encode input sentence pairs ( Equations 1 - 2 ) , which can be initialized using pre - trained word embeddings ( e.g. Glove 840B vectors ) , where is the word embedding vector of the - th word in , is that of word in .","O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
54,"Secondly , ESIM implements the local inference layer for enhancing the sentence information .","O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
55,First it calculates a similarity matrix based on and .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
56,It then gets the new expression for and with the equation below : where and represent the weighted summation of and .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
57,It further enhances the local inference information collected as below .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
58,"After the enhancement of local inference , another Bi - LSTM layer is used to capture local inference information and their context for inference composition .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
59,"Instead of summation adopted by Parikh et al . , ESIM proposes to compute both max and average pooling and feeds the concatenate fixed length vector to the final classifier : a fully connected multi - layer perceptron .","O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O"
60,"Figure [ reference ] shows a high - level view of the ESIM architecture , where the bottom LSTM1 layer of Figure [ reference ] is the input encoding layer ,","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
61,"the middle part with LSTM2 layer is the local inference layer , the upper part is the inference composition layer .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
62,subsection : aESIM model,"O,O,B,I"
63,The overall architecture of our newly proposed attention boosted sequential inference model ( named aESIM ) based on ESIM is similar to ESIM .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,O"
64,"In detail , aESIM also consists of four main parts : encoding layer , local inference modeling layer , decoding layer and classification layer .","O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,O,B,I,O"
65,The only difference between ESIM and aESIM is that we substitute the two Bi - LSTM layers ( LSTM1 and LSTM2 ) in ESIM with two Bi - aLSTM layers in aESIM .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,O,B,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,O"
66,"Therefore , as illustrated in Figure [ reference ] , the layers with red - dotted circles in ESIM will be replaced by the Bi - aLSTM layers shown in the right upper corner of the Figure [ reference ] and the details of Bi - aLSTM can be found in Figure [ reference ] .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
67,"Given the word vector of the - th word in sentence , which can be obtained by pre - trained word embeddings such as Glove 840B vectors in the first Bi - aLSTM layer or obtained from the local inference modeling layer in the second Bi - aLSTM layer .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
68,We utilize a forward LSTM layer and a backward LSTM layer to collect both direction information and .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
69,"As described in introduction section , in the following newly proposed Bi - aLSTM , we add word attention and additive operation on both orientations of traditional Bi - LSTM layer .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
70,Word attention layer,"B,I,I"
71,It ’s obvious that not all words contribute equally to the representation of a sentence .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
72,"Attention mechanism , which is introduced in , is extremely effective to extract vital words from the whole sentence , and is particularly beneficial to generate the sentence vector .","B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
73,"Therefore , we use the following attention mechanism after we get and .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
74,"Suppose , we then have where is obtained after one - layer MLP for the input , is the importance of word , is calculated by the SoftMax unit on the context vector of the sentence which is randomly initialized and modified during the training , is the attention enhanced vector through multiplying the weight and original vector , where correspond to the forward vector and the backward vector , respectively .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
75,"Adaptive word direction layer In traditional Bi - LSTM model , the forward and the backward vectors of a word are considered to have equal importance on the word representation .","B,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
76,The model simply connects the forward and backward vectors head and tail without weighing their importance .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
77,"For a word in different direction or orientation , the former and the latter words are reversed .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
78,"Thus , different direction vectors of a word make different contribution to the representation , especially the words in a long sentence .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
79,"Therefore , we propose a new adaptive direction layer to learn the contribution of different directions for a single word .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
80,"Formally , given two direction word vectors and , the whole word vector can be expressed as : where , and denote weight matrix and the bias , denotes the nonlinear function , denotes the concentration .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
81,All the parameters can be learned during training .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
82,Then we can get the whole sentence vector as below : This word and orientation enhanced Bi - LSTM is called Bi - aLSTM .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O"

728,section : Introduction,"O,O,O"
729,Reading comprehension - based question answering ( RCQA ) is the task of answering a question with a chunk of text taken from related document ( s ) .,"B,I,I,I,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
730,A variety of neural models have been proposed recently either for extracting a single entity or a single token as an answer from a given text ; or for selecting the correct answer by ranking a small set of human - provided candidates .,"O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
731,"In both cases , an answer boundary is either easy to determine or already given .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
732,"Different from the above two assumptions for RCQA , in the real - world QA scenario , people may ask questions about both entities ( factoid ) and non - entities such as explanations and reasons ( non - factoid ) ( see Table [ reference ] for examples ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
733,"In this regard , RCQA has the potential to complement other QA approaches that leverage structured data ( e.g. , knowledge bases ) for both the above question types .","O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
734,"This is because RCQA can exploit the textual evidences to ensure increased answer coverage , which is particularly helpful for non - factoid answers .","O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
735,"However , it is also challenging for RCQA to identify answer in arbitrary position in the passage with arbitrary length , especially for non - factoid answers which might be clauses or sentences .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
736,"As a result , apart from a few exceptions , this research direction has not been fully explored yet .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
737,"Compared to the relatively easier RC task of predicting single tokens / entities , predicting answers of arbitrary lengths and positions significantly increase the search space complexity : the number of possible candidates to consider is in the order of , where is the number of passage words .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

741,The rule - based chunking approach suffered from low coverage ( 70 % recall of answer chunks ) that can not be improved during training ; and candidate ranking performance depends greatly on the quality of the hand - crafted features .,"O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
742,"More recently , Wang and Jiang wang2016machine proposed two end - to - end neural network models , one of which chunks a candidate answer by predicting the answer ’s two boundary indices and the other classifies each passage word into answer / not - answer .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

1787,The core of our model is a Long Short - Term Memory ( LSTM ) unit with an extended memory tape that explicitly simulates the human memory span .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

1789,"In the following , we first review the standard Long Short - Term Memory and then describe our model .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
1790,subsection : Long Short - Term Memory,"O,O,B,I,I,I,I"
1791,"A Long Short - Term Memory ( LSTM ) recurrent neural network processes a variable - length sequence by incrementally adding new content into a single memory slot , with gates controlling the extent to which new content should be memorized , old content should be erased , and current content should be exposed .","O,B,I,I,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

1793,"Compared to the standard RNN , the LSTM uses additive memory updates and it separates the memory from the hidden state , which interacts with the environment when making predictions .","O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
1794,subsection : Long Short - Term Memory - Network,"O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I"
1795,The first question that arises with LSTMs is the extent to which they are able to memorize sequences under recursive compression .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
1796,"LSTMs can produce a list of state representations during composition , however , the next state is always computed from the current state .","B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
1797,"That is to say , given the current state , the next state is conditionally independent of states and tokens .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
1798,"While the recursive state update is performed in a Markov manner , it is assumed that LSTMs maintain unbounded memory ( i.e. , the current state alone summarizes well the tokens it has seen so far ) .","O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

1800,Another undesired property of LSTMs concerns modeling structured input .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,O"
1801,"An LSTM aggregates information on a token - by - token basis in sequential order , but there is no explicit mechanism for reasoning over structure and modeling relations between tokens .","O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
1802,Our model aims to address both limitations .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
1803,Our solution is to modify the standard LSTM structure by replacing the memory cell with a memory network .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
1804,The resulting Long Short - Term Memory - Network ( LSTMN ) stores the contextual representation of each input token with a unique memory slot and the size of the memory grows with time until an upper bound of the memory span is reached .,"O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
1805,This design enables the LSTM to reason about relations between tokens with a neural attention layer and then perform non - Markov state updates .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"

1808,"Although not the focus of this work , the significance of the write operation can be analogously justified as a way of incrementally updating previous memories , e.g. , to correct wrong interpretations when processing garden path sentences .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

1815,A key idea behind the LSTMN is to use attention for inducing relations between tokens .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
1816,"These relations are soft and differentiable , and components of a larger representation learning network .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"

2111,There are two test scenarios on VQA : open - ended and multiple - choice .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,O"
2112,The best performing method deeper LSTM Q + norm I from is used as our baseline .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

2119,We can see that our approach improves the state of art from 60.4 % ( DMN + ) to 62.1 % ( + ResNet ) on open - ended and from 64.2 % ( FDA ) to 66.1 % ( + ResNet ) on multiple - choice .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O"

2122,Our improvements are not solely due to the use of a better CNN .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"

2128,Both attention mechanisms have their advantages and disadvantages : parallel co - attention is harder to train because of the dot product between image and text which compresses two vectors into a single value .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

2632,"This effect has also been indirectly exploited when training a single network through dropout [ reference ] , dropconnect [ reference ] , or stochastic depth [ reference ] regularization methods , and in swapout networks [ reference ] , where training always focuses on a particular subset of the network , and thus the complete network can be seen as an implicit ensemble of such trained sub - networks .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"

2920,Language models trained on monolingual data have played a central role in statistical machine translation since the first IBM models [ reference ] ) .,"B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
2921,There are two major reasons for their importance .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
2922,"Firstly , word - based and phrase - based translation models make strong independence assumptions , with the probability of translation units estimated independently from context , and language models , by making different independence assumptions , can model how well these translation units fit together .","O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
2923,"Secondly , the amount of available monolingual data in the target language typically far exceeds the amount of parallel data , and models typically improve when trained on more data , or data more similar to the translation task .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
2924,"In ( attentional ) encoder - decoder architectures for neural machine translation [ reference ][ reference ] , the decoder is essentially an RNN language model that is also conditioned on source context , so the first rationale , adding a language model to compensate for the independence assumptions of the translation model , does not apply .","O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
2925,"However , the data argument is still valid in NMT , and we expect monolingual data to be especially helpful if parallel data is sparse , or a poor fit for the translation task , for instance because of a domain mismatch .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

3156,Semi - supervised learning aims to leverage unlabeled data to improve performance .,"B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3157,A large number of semi - supervised learning algorithms jointly optimize two training objective functions : the supervised loss over labeled data and the unsupervised loss over both labeled and unlabeled data .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3158,Graph - based semi - supervised learning defines the loss function as a weighted sum of the supervised loss over labeled instances and a graph Laplacian regularization term .,"B,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
3159,The graph Laplacian regularization is based on the assumption that nearby nodes in a graph are likely to have the same labels .,"O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3160,Graph Laplacian regularization is effective because it constrains the labels to be consistent with the graph structure .,"B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3161,"Recently developed unsupervised representation learning methods learn embeddings that predict a distributional context , e.g. a word embedding might predict nearby context words , or a node embedding might predict nearby nodes in a graph .","O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3162,Embeddings trained with distributional context can be used to boost the performance of related tasks .,"B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
3163,"For example , word embeddings trained from a language model can be applied to part - of - speech tagging , chunking and named entity recognition .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,B,O,B,I,I,O"
3164,In this paper we consider not word embeddings but graph embeddings .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O"
3165,"Existing results show that graph embeddings are effective at classifying the nodes in a graph , such as user behavior prediction in a social network .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,O"
3166,"However , the graph embeddings are usually learned separately from the supervised task , and hence do not leverage the label information in a specific task .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3167,Hence graph embeddings are in some sense complementary to graph Laplacian regularization that does not produce useful features itself and might not be able to fully leverage the distributional information encoded in the graph structure .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

3173,We then concatenate the embeddings and the hidden layers of the original classifier and feed them to a softmax layer when making the prediction .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O"
3174,"Since the embeddings are learned based on the graph structure , the above method is transductive , which means we can only predict instances that are already observed in the graph at training time .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

3696,"For most conditional generation tasks , the mappings are in nature multimodal , i.e. , a single input context corresponds to multiple plausible outputs .","O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3697,"A straightforward approach to handle multimodality is to take random noise vectors along with the conditional contexts as inputs , where the contexts determine the main content and noise vectors are responsible for variations .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

3703,The other methods use auxiliary networks such as multiple generators and additional encoders .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O"

3954,section : Introduction,"O,O,O"
3955,"Deep CNNs are well suited for large - scale learning based visual recognition tasks because of its highly scalable training algorithm , which only needs to cache a small chunk ( mini - batch ) of the potentially huge volume of training data during sequential scans ( epochs ) .","O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3956,They have achieved increasingly better performance in recent years .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3957,"As datasets become bigger and the number of object categories becomes larger , one of the complications that come along is that visual separability between different object categories is highly uneven .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3958,Some categories are much harder to distinguish than others .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3959,Take the categories in CIFAR100 as an example .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O"
3960,"It is easy to tell an Apple from a Bus , but harder to tell an Apple from an Orange .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3961,"In fact , both Apples and Oranges belong to the same coarse category fruit and vegetables while Buses belong to another coarse category vehicles 1 , as defined within CIFAR100 .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
3962,"Nonetheless , most deep CNN models nowadays are flat N - way classifiers , which share a set of fully connected layers .","O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3963,This makes us wonder whether such a flat structure is adequate for distinguishing all the difficult categories .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3964,A very natural and intuitive alternative organizes classifiers in a hierarchical manner according to the divide - and - conquer strategy .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O"
3965,"Although hierarchical classification has been proven effective for conventional linear classifiers , few attempts have been made to exploit category hierarchies in deep CNN models .","O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O"
3966,"Since deep CNN models are large models themselves , organizing them hierarchically imposes the following challenges .","O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3967,"First , instead of a handcrafted category hierarchy , how can we learn such a category hierarchy from the training data itself so that cascaded inferences in a hierarchical classifier will not degrade the overall accuracy while dedicated fine category classifiers exist for hard - to - distinguish categories ?","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3968,"Second , a hierarchical CNN classifier consists of multiple CNN models at different levels .","O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O"
3969,How can we leverage the commonalities among these models and effectively train them all ?,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3970,"Third , it would also be slower and more memory - consuming to run a hierarchical CNN classifier on a novel testing image .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3971,How can we alleviate such limitations ?,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3972,"In this paper , we propose a generic and principled hierarchical architecture , Hierarchical Deep Convolutional Neural Network ( HD - CNN ) , that decomposes an image classification task into two steps .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
3973,An HD - CNN first uses a coarse category CNN classifier to separate easy classes from one another .,"O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3974,More challenging classes are routed downstream to fine category classifiers that focus on confusing classes .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
3975,We adopt a module design principle and every HD - CNN is built upon a building block CNN .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
3976,The building block can be chosen to be any of the currently top ranked single CNNs .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
3977,Thus HD - CNNs can always benefit from the progress of single CNN design .,"O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O"
3978,An HD - CNN follows the coarse - to - fine classification paradigm and probabilistically integrates predictions from the fine category classifiers .,"O,O,O,B,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
3979,"Compared with the building block CNN , the corresponding HD - CNN can achieve lower error at the cost of a manageable increase in memory footprint and classification time .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O"

4499,section : Introduction,"O,O,O"
4500,Learning meaningful representations of data is an important step for models to understand the world .,"O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4501,"Recently , the Generative Adversarial Network ( GAN ) has been proposed as a method that can learn characteristics of data distributions without the need for labels .","O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4502,"GANs traditionally consist of a generator , which generates data from randomly sampled vectors , and a discriminator , which tries to distinguish generated data from real data .","B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4503,"During training , the generator learns to generate realistic data samples , while the discriminator becomes better at distinguishing between the generated and the real data .","O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4504,"As a result , both the generator and the discriminator learn characteristics about the underlying data distribution without the need for any labels .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4505,"One desirable characteristic of learned representations is disentanglement , which means that different parts of the representation encode different factors of the data - generating distribution .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4506,"This makes representations more interpretable , easier to modify , and is a useful property for many tasks such as classification , clustering , or image captioning .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,B,I,O"
4507,"To achieve this , Chen et al . introduced a GAN variant in which the generator ’s input is split into two parts and .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4508,"Here , encodes unstructured noise while encodes meaningful , data - generating factors .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4509,Through enforcing high mutual information between and and the generated images the generator is trained using the inputs as meaningful encodings for certain image characteristics .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4510,"For example , a ten - dimensional categorical code for could represent the ten different digit classes in the MNIST data set .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
4511,Since no labels are provided the generator has to learn by itself which image characteristics can be represented through .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4512,"One drawback of this model is that the only way to perform inference , i.e. map real data samples into a ( disentangled ) representation , is to use the discriminator .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
4513,"However , there is no guarantee that the discriminator learns good representations of the data in general , as it is trained to discriminate between real and generated data and may therefore focus only on features that are helpful for discriminating these two , but are not necessarily descriptive of the data distribution in general .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4514,Zhang et al . tried to enforce disentangled representations in order to improve the controllability of the generator .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4515,The latent representation is split up into two parts encoding meaningful information and unknown factors of variation .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4516,Two additional inference networks are introduced to enforce the disentanglement between the two parts of the latent representation .,"O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
4517,"While this setup yields a better controllability over the generative process it depends on labeled samples for its training objective and can not discover unknown data - generating factors , but only encodes known factors of variation ( obtained through labels ) in its disentangled representation .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
4518,Donahue et al . and Dumoulin et al . introduced an extension which includes an encoder that learns the encodings of real data samples .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4519,The discriminator gets as input both the data sample ( either real or generated ) and the according representation ( either or ) and has to classify them as either coming from the generator or the encoder .,"O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,O"
4520,The generator and the encoder try to fool the discriminator into misclassifying the samples .,"O,B,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O"
4521,"As a result , the encoder learns to approximate the inverse of the generator and can be used to map real data samples into representations for other applications .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4522,"However , in these approaches the representations follow a simple prior , e.g. a Gaussian or uniform distribution , and do not exhibit any disentangled properties .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4523,"Our model , the Bidirectional - InfoGAN , integrates some of these approaches by extending traditional GANs with an encoder that learns disentangled representations in an unsupervised setting .","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O"
4524,"After training , the encoder can map data points to meaningful , disentangled representations which can potentially be used for different tasks such as classification , clustering , or image captioning .","O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,B,I,O"
4525,Compared to the InfoGAN we introduce an encoder to mitigate the problems of using a discriminator for both the adversarial loss and the inference task .,"O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O"
4526,"Unlike the Structured GAN our training procedure is completely unsupervised , can detect unknown data - generating factors , and only introduces one additional inference network ( the encoder ) .","O,O,O,B,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O,O"
4527,In contrast to the Bidirectional GAN we replace the simple prior on the latent representation with a distribution that is amenable to disentangled representations and introduce an additional loss for the encoder and the generator to achieve disentangled representations .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O"
4528,"On the MNIST , CelebA , and SVHN data sets we show that the encoder does learn interpretable representations which encode meaningful properties of the data distribution .","O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
4529,"Using these we can sample images that exhibit certain characteristics , e.g. digit identity and specific stroke widths for the MNIST data set , or different hair colors and clothing accessories in the CelebA data set .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5050,subsection : Learning Vector Representation of Words,"O,O,B,I,I,I,I"
5051,This section introduces the concept of distributed vector representation of words .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
5052,A well known framework for learning the word vectors is shown in Figure [ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5053,The task is to predict a word given the other words in a context .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5054,"In this framework , every word is mapped to a unique vector , represented by a column in a matrix .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5055,The column is indexed by position of the word in the vocabulary .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5056,The concatenation or sum of the vectors is then used as features for prediction of the next word in a sentence .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5057,"More formally , given a sequence of training words , the objective of the word vector model is to maximize the average log probability","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I"
5058,"The prediction task is typically done via a multiclass classifier , such as softmax .","O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O"
5059,"There , we have Each of is un - normalized log - probability for each output word , computed as where are the softmax parameters . is constructed by a concatenation or average of word vectors extracted from .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O"
5060,"In practice , hierarchical softmax is preferred to softmax for fast training .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,O"
5061,"In our work , the structure of the hierarical softmax is a binary Huffman tree , where short codes are assigned to frequent words .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5062,This is a good speedup trick because common words are accessed quickly .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5063,This use of binary Huffman code for the hierarchy is the same with .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5064,The neural network based word vectors are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent where the gradient is obtained via backpropagation .,"O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
5065,This type of models is commonly known as neural language models .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
5066,A particular implementation of neural network based algorithm for training the word vectors is available at code.google.com / p / word2vec / .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5067,"After the training converges , words with similar meaning are mapped to a similar position in the vector space .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5068,"For example , “ powerful ” and “ strong ” are close to each other , whereas “ powerful ” and “ Paris ” are more distant .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5069,The difference between word vectors also carry meaning .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5070,"For example , the word vectors can be used to answer analogy questions using simple vector algebra : “","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O"

5076,It is also possible to learn a linear matrix to translate words and phrases between languages .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5077,"These properties make word vectors attractive for many natural language processing tasks such as language modeling , natural language understanding , statistical machine translation , image understanding and relational extraction .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,O,B,I,O"
5078,subsection : Paragraph Vector : A distributed memory model,"O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I"
5079,Our approach for learning paragraph vectors is inspired by the methods for learning the word vectors .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5080,The inspiration is that the word vectors are asked to contribute to a prediction task about the next word in the sentence .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5081,"So despite the fact that the word vectors are initialized randomly , they can eventually capture semantics as an indirect result of the prediction task .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"

5410,Our generative model defines a joint distribution on trees ( ) and sequences of words ( ) .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5411,"To evaluate this as a language model , it is necessary to compute the marginal probability .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5413,"However , because of the unbounded dependencies across the sequence of parsing actions in our model , exactly solving either of these inference problems is intractable .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O"
5414,"To obtain estimates of these , we use a variant of importance sampling .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
5415,Our importance sampling algorithm uses a conditional proposal distribution with the following properties : ( i ) ; ( ii ) samples can be obtained efficiently ; and ( iii ) the conditional probabilities of these samples are known .,"O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5416,"While many such distributions are available , the discriminatively trained variant of our parser ( § [ reference ] ) fulfills these requirements : sequences of actions can be sampled using a simple ancestral sampling approach , and , since parse trees and action sequences exist in a one - to - one relationship , the product of the action probabilities is the conditional probability of the parse tree under .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5647,section : Language Modeling,"O,O,B,I"
5648,"We now turn to the description of the language modeling component of the Snips platform , which is responsible for the extraction of the intent and slots from the output of the acoustic model .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
5649,This component is made up of two closely - interacting parts .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5650,"The first is the language model ( LM ) , that turns the predictions of the acoustic model into likely sentences , taking into account the probability of co - occurrence of words .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5651,"The second is the Natural Language Understanding ( NLU ) model , that extracts intent and slots from the prediction of the Automatic Speech Recognition ( ASR ) engine .","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O"
5652,"In typical commercial large vocabulary speech recognition systems , the LM component is usually the largest in size , and can take up to terabytes of storage .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5653,"Indeed , to account for the high variability of general spoken language , large vocabulary language models need to be trained on very large text corpora .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5654,"The size of these models also has an impact on decoding performance : the search space of the ASR is expanded , making speech recognition harder and more computationally demanding .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5655,"Additionally , the performance of an ASR engine on a given domain will strongly depend on the perplexity of its LM on queries from this domain , making the choice of the training text corpus critical .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5656,This question is sometimes addressed through massive use of users ’ private data .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5657,"One option to overcome these challenges is to specialize the language model of the assistant to a certain domain , e.g. by restricting its vocabulary as well as the variety of the queries it should model .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5659,"In fact , while the performance of an ASR engine alone can be measured using e.g. the word error rate as in the previous section , we assess the performance of the SLU system through its end - to - end , speech - to - meaning accuracy , i.e. its ability to correctly predict the intent and slots of a spoken utterance .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5710,"The generalization properties of the ASR engine are preserved by using a statistical n - gram LM allowing to mix parts of the training queries to create new ones , and by using class - based language modeling where the value of each entity may be replaced by any other .","O,B,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5711,We now detail the resulting LM construction strategy .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O"

5714,"For example , the query","O,O,O,O,O"

5727,"For instance , in the example above , the arcs of carrying the ‘","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5728,‘ ARTIST ’’ symbol are expanded into the wFST representing the ‘ ‘ artist ’’ entity .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5729,This process is represented on a simple LM on Figure [ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5745,We will refer to the result of equation [ reference ] as a static model in the following .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O"
5746,"In the context of embedded inference , a major drawback of this standard method is the necessity to compute and load the static HCLG decoding graph in memory in order to perform speech recognition .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
5747,"The size of this decoding graph can claim a large chunk of the GB of RAM available on a Raspberry Pi 3 , or even be too big for smaller devices .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5748,"Additionally , since LMs are trained synchronously in the Snips web console after the user has created their dataset ( see section [ reference ] ) , it is important for the decoding graph to be generated as fast as possible .","O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5749,"For these reasons , a dynamic language model , composing the various transducers upon request instead of ahead of time , is employed .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5750,This is achieved by replacing the compositions of equation ( [ reference ] ) by delayed ( or lazy ) ones .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5751,"Consequently , the states and transitions of the complete HCLG decoding graph are not computed at the time of creation , but rather at runtime during the inference , notably speeding up the building of the decoding graph .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
5752,"Additionally , employing lazy composition allows to break the decoding graph into two pieces ( HCL on one hand , and G on the other ) .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5754,"In order to preserve the decoding speed of the ASR engine using a dynamic language model , a better composition algorithm using lazy look - ahead operations must be used .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5756,"In the case of a static decoding graph , these states are removed through a final optimization step of the HCLG that can not be applied in the dynamic case because the full HCLG is never built .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O"
5757,This issue can be addressed through the use of composition filters .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
5758,"In particular , the use of look - ahead filters followed by label - reachability filters with weights and labels pushing allows to discard inaccessible and costly decoding hypotheses early in the decoding .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
5759,The lexicon can therefore be composed with the language model while simultaneously optimizing the resulting transducer .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
5760,"Finally , the Replace operation of equation ( [ reference ] ) is also delayed .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5761,"This allows to further break the decoding graph into smaller distinct pieces : the transducer mapping the output of the acoustic model to words , the query language model , and the entities languages models .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"

5764,"Additionally , this greatly reduces the training time of the LM .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O"

5770,A straightforward way of customizing the LM previously described is to update the list of values each entity can take .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5771,"For instance , if we consider an assistant dedicated to making phone calls ( ‘ ‘ call ( Jane Doe )[ contact ] ’ ’ ) , the user ’s list of contacts could be added to the values of the entity","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5774,This operation is called entity injection in the following .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O"
5775,"In order to perform entity injection , two modifications of the decoding graph are necessary .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5776,"First , the new words and their pronunciations are added to the transducer .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
5777,"Second , the new values are added to the corresponding entity wFST .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5779,Pronunciations for words absent from the transducer are computed via an embedded G2P.,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I"
5780,The updated transducer can then be fully recompiled and optimized .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5781,The procedure for adding a new value to varies depending on whether a union of word acceptors or an n - gram model is used .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O"
5782,"In the former case , an acceptor of the new value is created and its union with is computed .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5822,"Let us consider , for instance , the training sample : set the [ kitchen ]( room ) lights to [ blue ]( color ) Let us assume that the set of possible values for the room entity are kitchen , hall , bedroom and those for the color entity are blue , yellow , red .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5828,paragraph : Probabilistic Intent Parser .,"O,O,B,I,I,O"
5829,The probabilistic intent parser aims at extending parsing beyond training examples and recognizing variations which do not appear in the training data .,"O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5830,It provides the generalization power that the deterministic parser lacks .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O"
5831,This parser runs in two cascaded steps : intent classification and slot filling .,"O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O"
5832,The intent classification is implemented with a logistic regression trained on the queries from every intent .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5833,"The slot - filling step consists in several linear - chain Conditional Random Fields ( CRFs ) , each of them being trained for a specific intent .","O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5834,"Once the intent is extracted by the intent classifier , the corresponding slot filler is used to extract slots from the query .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5835,The choice of CRFs for the slot - filling step results from careful considerations and experiments .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5836,"They are indeed a standard approach for this task , and are known to have low generalization error .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
5837,"Recently , more computationally demanding approaches based on deep learning models have been proposed .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O"
5838,Our experiments however showed that these approaches do not yield any significant gain in accuracy in the typical training size regime of custom voice assistants ( a few hundred queries ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5839,The lightest option was therefore favored .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5840,"On top of the classical features used in slot - filling tasks such as n - grams , case , shape , etc . , additional features are crafted .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5841,"In this kind of task , it appears that leveraging external knowledge is crucial .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5842,"Hence , we apply a built - in entity extractor ( see next paragraph about Entity Resolution ) to build features that indicate whether or not a token in the sentence is part of a built - in entity .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5845,The problem of data sparsity is addressed by integrating features based on word clusters .,"O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
5846,"More specifically , we use Brown clusters released by the authors of , as well as word clusters built from word2vec embeddings using k - means clustering .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,O"

5850,Table [ reference ] displays some examples of features used in Snips NLU .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
5851,Overfitting is avoided by dropping a fraction of the features during training .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5852,"More precisely , each feature is assigned a dropout probability .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5929,"Once the scope of an assistant has been defined , a mix of crowdsourcing and semi - supervised machine learning is used to generate thousands of high - quality training examples , mimicking user data collection without compromising on privacy .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5931,subsection : Data generation pipeline,"O,O,B,I,I"
5932,"A first simple approach to data generation is grammar - based generation , which consists in breaking down a written query into consecutive semantic blocks and requires enumerating every possible pattern in the chosen language .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5933,"While this method guarantees an exact slot and intent supervision , queries generated in this way are highly correlated : their diversity is limited to the expressive power of the used grammar and the imagination of the person having created it .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5935,This approach is therefore unfit for generating queries in natural language .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
5936,"On the other hand , crowdsourcing – widely used in Natural Language Processing research – ensures diversity in formulation by sampling queries from a large number of demographically diverse contributors .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5945,Local crowdsourcing platforms therefore had to be integrated .,"O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5946,A text query generation task consists in generating an example of user query matching a provided set of intent and slots –,"O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5947,e.g. the following set,"O,O,O,O"
5948,: Intent : The user wants to switch the lights on ; slot : ( bedroom )[ room ] could result in the generated query,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5951,I want lights in the bedroom right now !,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5953,"Fixing entity values reduces the task to a sentence generation and removes the need for a slot labeling step , limiting the sources of error .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5954,Diversity is enforced by both submitting this task to the widest possible crowd while limiting the number of available tasks per contributor and by selecting large sets of slot values .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5956,Majority voting is indeed a simple and straightforward approach for quality assessment in crowdsourcing .,"B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O"
5957,"A custom dashboard hosted on our servers has been developed to optimize the contributor ’s workflow , with clear descriptions of the task .","O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5958,"The dashboard also prevents a contributor from submitting a query that does not contain the imposed entity values , with a fuzzy matching rule allowing for inflections in all supported languages ( conjugation , plural , gender , compounds , etc . ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5960,"While the previous validation step allows to filter out most spelling and formulation mistakes , it does not always guarantee the correctness of the intent or the absence of spurious entities .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5961,"Indeed , in a first type of errors , the intent of the query may not match the provided one –","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5962,e.g. Switch off the lights when the intent SwitchLightOn was required .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

5970,These errors in the training queries must be fixed to achieve a high accuracy of the SLU .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,O"
5971,"To do so , we perform a 3 - fold cross validation of the NLU engine on this dataset .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O"
5972,This yields predicted intents and slots for each sentence in the dataset .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5973,"By repeating this procedure several times , we obtain several predictions for each sentence .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
5974,We then apply majority voting on these predictions to detect missing slots and wrong intents .,"O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

6017,section : Introduction,"O,O,O"
6018,"Object detectors based on convolutional neural networks ( ConvNets ) [ reference ][ reference ][ reference ] have achieved state - of - the - art results on various challenging benchmarks [ reference ][ reference ][ reference ] . A common component of state - of - the - art approaches is anchor boxes [ reference ][ reference ] , which are boxes of various sizes and aspect ratios that serve as detection candidates .","B,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6019,"Anchor boxes are extensively used in one - stage detectors [ reference ][ reference ][ reference ] , which can achieve results highly competitive with two - stage detectors [ reference ][ reference ][ reference ][ reference ] while being more efficient .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6020,One - stage detectors place anchor boxes densely over an image and generate final box predictions by scoring anchor boxes and refining their coordinates through regression .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
6021,But the use of anchor boxes has two drawbacks .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6022,"First , we typically need a very large set of anchor boxes , e.g. more than 40k in DSSD and more than 100k in RetinaNet .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6023,"This is because the detector is trained to classify whether each anchor box sufficiently overlaps with a ground truth box , and a large number of anchor boxes is needed to ensure sufficient overlap with most ground truth boxes .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6024,"As a result , only a tiny fraction of anchor boxes will overlap with ground truth ; this creates a huge imbalance between positive and negative anchor boxes and slows down training .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
6025,"Second , the use of anchor boxes introduces many hyperparameters and design choices .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6026,"These include how many boxes , what sizes , and what aspect ratios .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6027,"Such choices have largely been made via ad - hoc heuristics , and can become even more complicated when combined with multiscale architectures where a single network makes separate predictions at multiple resolutions , with each scale using different features and its own set of anchor boxes [ reference ][ reference ][ reference ] .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

6339,section : Introduction,"O,O,O"
6340,We study the reinforcement learning ( RL ) problem where an agent interacts with an unknown environment .,"O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6341,The agent takes a sequence of actions in order to maximize cumulative rewards .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6342,"Unlike standard planning problems , an RL agent does not begin with perfect knowledge of the environment , but learns through experience .","O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6343,"This leads to a fundamental trade - off of exploration versus exploitation ; the agent may improve its future rewards by exploring poorly understood states and actions , but this may require sacrificing immediate rewards .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6344,To learn efficiently an agent should explore only when there are valuable learning opportunities .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6345,"Further , since any action may have long term consequences , the agent should reason about the informational value of possible observation sequences .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6346,"Without this sort of temporally extended ( deep ) exploration , learning times can worsen by an exponential factor .","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
6347,The theoretical RL literature offers a variety of provably - efficient approaches to deep exploration .,"O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
6348,"However , most of these are designed for Markov decision processes ( MDPs ) with small finite state spaces , while others require solving computationally intractable planning tasks .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
6349,These algorithms are not practical in complex environments where an agent must generalize to operate effectively .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

7909,section : Introduction,"O,O,O"
7910,"In this paper we present a unified system for face verification ( is this the same person ) , recognition ( who is this person ) and clustering ( find common people among these faces ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
7911,Our method is based on learning a Euclidean embedding per image using a deep convolutional network .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,O,O"
7912,The network is trained such that the squared L2 distances in the embedding space directly correspond to face similarity : faces of the same person have small distances and faces of distinct people have large distances .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
7913,"Once this embedding has been produced , then the aforementioned tasks become straight - forward : face verification simply involves thresholding the distance between the two embeddings ; recognition becomes a k - NN classification problem ; and clustering can be achieved using off - the - shelf techniques such as k - means or agglomerative clustering .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,O"
7914,Previous face recognition approaches based on deep networks use a classification layer trained over a set of known face identities and then take an intermediate bottleneck layer as a representation used to generalize recognition beyond the set of identities used in training .,"O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
7915,The downsides of this approach are its indirectness and its inefficiency : one has to hope that the bottleneck representation generalizes well to new faces ; and by using a bottleneck layer the representation size per face is usually very large ( 1000s of dimensions ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
7916,"Some recent work has reduced this dimensionality using PCA , but this is a linear transformation that can be easily learnt in one layer of the network .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
7917,"In contrast to these approaches , FaceNet directly trains its output to be a compact 128 - D embedding using a triplet - based loss function based on LMNN .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,O"
7918,Our triplets consist of two matching face thumbnails and a non - matching face thumbnail and the loss aims to separate the positive pair from the negative by a distance margin .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

7920,"Choosing which triplets to use turns out to be very important for achieving good performance and , inspired by curriculum learning , we present a novel online negative exemplar mining strategy which ensures consistently increasing difficulty of triplets as the network trains .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

8081,The network is surprisingly robust with respect to JPEG compression and performs very well down to a JPEG quality of 20 .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O"
8082,The performance drop is very small for face thumbnails down to a size of 120x120 pixels and even at 80x80 pixels it shows acceptable performance .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8083,"This is notable , because the network was trained on 220x220 input images .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8084,Training with lower resolution faces could improve this range further .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8085,subsection : Embedding Dimensionality,"O,O,B,I"
8086,We explored various embedding dimensionalities and selected 128 for all experiments other than the comparison reported in Table [ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8087,"One would expect the larger embeddings to perform at least as good as the smaller ones , however , it is possible that they require more training to achieve the same accuracy .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
8088,"That said , the differences in the performance reported in Table [ reference ] are statistically insignificant .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8089,"It should be noted , that during training a 128 dimensional float vector is used , but it can be quantized to 128 - bytes without loss of accuracy .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
8090,"Thus each face is compactly represented by a 128 dimensional byte vector , which is ideal for large scale clustering and recognition .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
8091,Smaller embeddings are possible at a minor loss of accuracy and could be employed on mobile devices .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8092,subsection : Amount of Training Data,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
8093,Table [ reference ] shows the impact of large amounts of training data .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8094,Due to time constraints this evaluation was run on a smaller model ; the effect may be even larger on larger models .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8095,It is clear that using tens of millions of exemplars results in a clear boost of accuracy on our personal photo test set from section [ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8096,Compared to only millions of images the relative reduction in error is 60 % .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O"
8097,"Using another order of magnitude more images ( hundreds of millions ) still gives a small boost , but the improvement tapers off .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

8100,"We evaluate our model on LFW using the standard protocol for unrestricted , labeled outside data .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8101,Nine training splits are used to select the - distance threshold .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8102,Classification ( same or different ) is then performed on the tenth test split .,"B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8103,The selected optimal threshold is for all test splits except split eighth ( ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8104,Our model is evaluated in two modes : Fixed center crop of the LFW provided thumbnail .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O"
8105,A proprietary face detector ( similar to Picasa ) is run on the provided LFW thumbnails .,"O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
8106,"If it fails to align the face ( this happens for two images ) , the LFW alignment is used .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O"
8107,Figure [ reference ] gives an overview of all failure cases .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8108,It shows false accepts on the top as well as false rejects at the bottom .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8109,We achieve a classification accuracy of 98.87%±0.15 when using the fixed center crop described in ( 1 ) and the record breaking 99.63%± 0.09 standard error of the mean when using the extra face alignment ( 2 ) .,"O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

8114,This gives us a classification accuracy of 95.12%±0.39 .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O"
8115,Using the first one thousand frames results in 95.18 % .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8116,Compared to 91.4 % who also evaluate one hundred frames per video we reduce the error rate by almost half .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O"

8123,section : Summary,"O,O,O"
8124,We provide a method to directly learn an embedding into an Euclidean space for face verification .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
8125,"This sets it apart from other methods who use the CNN bottleneck layer , or require additional post - processing such as concatenation of multiple models and PCA , as well as SVM classification .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
8126,Our end - to - end training both simplifies the setup and shows that directly optimizing a loss relevant to the task at hand,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O"

8128,Another strength of our model is that it only requires minimal alignment ( tight crop around the face area ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8129,", for example , performs a complex 3D alignment .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
8130,We also experimented with a similarity transform alignment and notice that this can actually improve performance slightly .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8131,It is not clear if it is worth the extra complexity .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

8134,section : Appendix : Harmonic Embedding,"O,O,O,O,B,I"
8135,In this section we introduce the concept of harmonic embeddings .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
8136,By this we denote a set of embeddings that are generated by different models v1 and v2 but are compatible in the sense that they can be compared to each other .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8137,This compatibility greatly simplifies upgrade paths .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8138,"in an scenario where embedding v1 was computed across a large set of images and a new embedding model v2 is being rolled out , this compatibility ensures a smooth transition without the need to worry about version incompatibilities .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8139,Figure [ reference ] shows results on our 3 G dataset .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8140,"It can be seen that the improved model NN2 significantly outperforms NN1 , while the comparison of NN2 embeddings to NN1 embeddings performs at an intermediate level .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8141,subsection : Harmonic Triplet Loss,"O,O,O,O,O"
8142,"In order to learn the harmonic embedding we mix embeddings of v1 together with the embeddings v2 , that are being learned .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8143,This is done inside the triplet loss and results in additionally generated triplets that encourage the compatibility between the different embedding versions .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8144,Figure [ reference ] visualizes the different combinations of triplets that contribute to the triplet loss .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8145,We initialized the v2 embedding from an independently trained NN2 and retrained the last layer ( embedding layer ) from random initialization with the compatibility encouraging triplet loss .,"O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8146,"First only the last layer is retrained , then we continue training the whole v2 network with the harmonic loss .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
8147,Figure [ reference ] shows a possible interpretation of how this compatibility may work in practice .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8148,"The vast majority of v2 embeddings may be embedded near the corresponding v1 embedding , however , incorrectly placed v1 embeddings can be perturbed slightly such that their new location in embedding space improves verification accuracy .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
8149,subsection : Summary,"O,O,O"
8150,These are very interesting findings and it is somewhat surprising that it works so well .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8151,Future work can explore how far this idea can be extended .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8152,"Presumably there is a limit as to how much the v2 embedding can improve over v1 , while still being compatible .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8153,Additionally it would be interesting to train small networks that can run on a mobile phone and are compatible to a larger server side model .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"

8178,Many important tasks in network analysis involve predictions over nodes and edges .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8179,"In a typical node classification task , we are interested in predicting the most probable labels of nodes in a network .","O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8180,"For example , in a social network , we might be interested in predicting interests of users , or in a protein - protein interaction network we might be interested in predicting functional labels of proteins .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8181,"Similarly , in link prediction , we wish to predict whether a pair of nodes in a network should have an edge connecting them .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8182,"Link prediction is useful in a wide variety of domains ; for instance , in genomics , it helps us discover novel interactions between genes , and in social networks , it can identify real - world friends .","B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8183,"Any supervised machine learning algorithm requires a set of informative , discriminating , and independent features .","O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8184,In prediction problems on networks this means that one has to construct a feature vector representation for the nodes and edges .,"O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8185,A typical solution involves hand - engineering domain - specific features based on expert knowledge .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8186,"Even if one discounts the tedious effort required for feature engineering , such features are usually designed for specific tasks and do not generalize across different prediction tasks .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
8187,An alternative approach is to learn feature representations by solving an optimization problem .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,O"
8188,"The challenge in feature learning is defining an objective function , which involves a trade - off in balancing computational efficiency and predictive accuracy .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,O"
8189,"On one side of the spectrum , one could directly aim to find a feature representation that optimizes performance of a downstream prediction task .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
8190,"While this supervised procedure results in good accuracy , it comes at the cost of high training time complexity due to a blowup in the number of parameters that need to be estimated .","O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8191,"At the other extreme , the objective function can be defined to be independent of the downstream prediction task and the representations can be learned in a purely unsupervised way .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
8192,"This makes the optimization computationally efficient and with a carefully designed objective , it results in task - independent features that closely match task - specific approaches in predictive accuracy .","O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"

8194,"Classic approaches based on linear and non - linear dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis , Multi - Dimensional Scaling and their extensions optimize an objective that transforms a representative data matrix of the network such that it maximizes the variance of the data representation .","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"

8539,"In this paper , we studied feature learning in networks as a search - based optimization problem .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
8540,This perspective gives us multiple advantages .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8541,It can explain classic search strategies on the basis of the exploration - exploitation trade - off .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O"

8543,"For instance , we observed that BFS can explore only limited neighborhoods .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8544,This makes BFS suitable for characterizing structural equivalences in network that rely on the immediate local structure of nodes .,"O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8545,"On the other hand , DFS can freely explore network neighborhoods which is important in discovering homophilous communities at the cost of high variance .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
8546,Both DeepWalk and LINE can be seen as rigid search strategies over networks .,"O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O"
8547,DeepWalk proposes search using uniform random walks .,"B,O,B,O,B,I,I,O"
8548,The obvious limitation with such a strategy is that it gives us no control over the explored neighborhoods .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8549,"LINE proposes primarily a breadth - first strategy , sampling nodes and optimizing the likelihood independently over only 1 - hop and 2 - hop neighbors .","B,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8550,"The effect of such an exploration is easier to characterize , but it is restrictive and provides no flexibility in exploring nodes at further depths .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

8553,"From a practical standpoint , node2vec is scalable and robust to perturbations .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
8554,We showed how extensions of node embeddings to link prediction outperform popular heuristic scores designed specifically for this task .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"

9127,The nodes of any two graphs are not necessarily in correspondence .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

9130,We propose a framework for learning representations for classes of directed and undirected graphs .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O"
9131,The graphs may have nodes and edges with multiple discrete and continuous attributes and may have multiple types of edges .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

9136,An image can be represented as a square grid graph whose nodes represent pixels .,"O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O"

9425,It is considered a fundamentally harder problem than semantic segmentation - where overlapping objects of the same class are segmented as one - and is closely related to the tasks of object counting and object detection .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O"

9430,"One key factor that complicates the naive application of the popular softmax cross - entropy loss function to instance segmentation , is the fact that an image can contain an arbitrary number of instances and that the labeling is permutation - invariant : it does not matter which specific label an instance gets , as long as it is different from all other instance labels .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
9431,"One possible solution is to set an upper limit to the number of detectable instances and to impose extra constraints on the labeling , but this may unnecessarily limit the representational power of the network and introduce unwanted biases , leading to unsatisfying results .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

9550,"One big limitation of detect - and - segment approaches that is not immediately apparent from their excellent results on popular benchmarks , is that they rely on the assumption that an object ’s segmentation mask can be unambiguously extracted from its bounding box .","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

9552,"However , the assumption is problematic for tasks where an object ’s bounding box conveys insufficient information to recover the object ’s segmentation mask .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
9553,Consider the synthetic scattered sticks dataset shown in figure [ reference ] as an example to illustrate the issue .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
9554,"When two sticks overlap like two crossed swords , their bounding boxes are highly overlapping .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
9555,"Given only a detection in the form of a bounding box , it is exceedingly hard to unambigously extract a segmentation mask of the indicated object .","O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
9556,Methods that rely on bounding boxes in their pipeline all suffer from this issue .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
9557,"In contrast , our method can handle such complex occlusions without problems as it treats the image holistically and learns to reason about occlusions , but does not employ a computationally expensive CRF like .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O"

9560,"On the other hand , our method also has some drawbacks .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
9561,"Due to the holistic treatment of the image , our method performs well on datasets with a lot of similarity across the images ( traffic scenes in Cityscapes or leaf configurations in CVPPP ) , but underperforms on datasets where objects can appear in random constellations and diverse settings , like Pascal VOC and MSCOCO .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O"

9780,"Furthermore , if the four quadrants can move independently ( of course , within some extent ) , it can be calculated more efficiently as : When applied recursively to each quadrant by subdivided it into 4 sub - quadrants until a minimum patch size is reached ( atomic patches ) , this strategy allows for accurate non - rigid matching .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"

10145,The new alternative is to start from all possible points in the top pyramid level .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
10146,Scoring scheme : In DM * we scored atomic correspondences based on the correlation values of start and end point of the backtracking path .,"B,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
10147,The new scoring scheme is the sum of correlation values along the full backtracking path .,"O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
10148,We report results for the different variants in Table on each dataset .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
10149,The first two rows for each dataset correspond to the exact settings used for DM,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B"

10151,We observe a steady increase in performance on all datasets when we add the new scoring and backtracking approach .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
10152,We can observe that starting from all possible entry points in the top pyramid level ( i.e. considering all possible translations ) yields slightly better results than starting from local maxima .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
10153,This demonstrates that some ground - truth matches are not covered by any local maximum .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

10156,"This is because ( 1 ) searching and storing local maxima ( which are exponentially more numerous in lower pyramid levels ) is not necessary anymore , and ( 2 ) the new scoring scheme allows for further optimization , i.e. early pruning of backtracking paths ( Section ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O"

10159,We evaluate and compare two different ways of reducing the computational load .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
10160,"The first one simply consists in downsizing the input images , and upscaling the resulting matches accordingly .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
10161,The second option is the compression scheme proposed in Section [ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
10162,We evaluate both schemes jointly by varying the input image size ( expressed as a fraction of the original resolution ) and the size of the prototype dictionary ( i.e . parameter of k - means in Section [ reference ] ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

10172,"As expected , only the bottom - up pass is affected by the approximation , with a run - time of the different operations involved ( patch correlations , max - pooling , subsampling , aggregation and non - linear rectification ) roughly proportional to D ( or to |G4| , the actual number of atomic patches , if = D∞ ) .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,B,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

10455,4.1 Data Augmentation,"O,B,I"
10456,"The easiest and most common method to reduce overfitting on image data is to artificially enlarge the dataset using label - preserving transformations ( e.g. , [ 25 , 4 , 5 ] ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

10459,"So these data augmentation schemes are , in effect , computationally free .","O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
10460,The first form of data augmentation consists of generating image translations and horizontal reflections .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O"
10461,We do this by extracting random 224 ⇥ 224 patches ( and their horizontal reflections ) from the 256 ⇥ 256 images and training our network on these extracted patches4 .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

10897,"The hidden Markov model ( HMM ) converts this sequence - level classification task into a frame - level classification problem , where each acoustic frame is classified into one of the hidden states , and each output sequence corresponds to a sequence of hidden states .","O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

10905,CTC deals with this problem by replicating the output labels so that a consecutive frames may correspond to the same output label or a blank token .,"B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

11039,section : The DRAW Network,"O,O,O,B,O"
11040,The basic structure of a DRAW network is similar to that of other variational auto - encoders : an encoder network determines a distribution over latent codes that capture salient information about the input data ; a decoder network receives samples from the code distribuion and uses them to condition its own distribution over images .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11041,However there are three key differences .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11042,"Firstly , both the encoder and decoder are recurrent networks in DRAW , so that a sequence of code samples is exchanged between them ; moreover the encoder is privy to the decoder","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

11044,"Secondly , the decoder ’s outputs are successively added to the distribution that will ultimately generate the data , as opposed to emitting this distribution in a single step .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

11185,"However , one of the limitations of the SQuAD task is that each question has a correct answer in the context passage , therefore most models just need to select the most relevant text span as the answer , without necessarily checking whether it is indeed the answer to the question .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"

11192,"These later laws had a low cost to societyâthe species were relatively rareâand little opposition was raised.â To do well on MRC with unanswerable questions , the model needs to comprehend the question , reason among the passage , judge the unanswerability and then identify the answer span .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11193,"Since extensive work has been done on how to correctly predict the answer span when the question is answerable ( e.g. , SQuAD 1.1 ) , the main challenge of this task lies in how to reliably determine whether a question is not answerable from the passage .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11194,There are two kinds of approaches to model the answerability of a question .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
11195,One approach is to directly extend previous MRC models by introducing a no - answer score to the score vector of the answer span .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11196,But this kind of approaches is relatively simple and can not effectively model the answerability of a question .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
11197,Another approach introduces an answer verifier to determine whether the question is unanswerable .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O"
11198,"However , this kind of approaches usually has a pipeline structure .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
11199,"The answer pointer and answer verifier have their respective models , which are trained separately .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

11203,We propose the U - Net to incorporate these three sub - tasks into a unified model : 1 ) an answer pointer to predict a candidate answer span for a question ; 2 ) a no - answer pointer to avoid selecting any text span when a question has no answer ; and 3 ) an answer verifier to determine the probability of the “ unanswerability ” of a question with candidate answer information .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O"

11205,The universal node acts on both question and passage to learn whether the question is answerable .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O"

11562,"These embeddings were used to initialize our network but not fixed , they were later modified during training .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11563,We discuss the impact of pre - training in the experimental section .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O"
11564,We do not apply any other special preprocessing to the data .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11565,"In particular , we do not binarize the parse trees or handle unaries in any specific way .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11566,We also treat unknown words in a naive way : we map all words beyond our 90 K vocabulary to a single UNK token .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11567,"This potentially underestimates our final results , but keeps our framework task - independent .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11568,section : Experiments,"O,O,O"
11569,subsection : Training Data,"O,O,O,O"
11570,We trained the model described above on 2 different datasets .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11571,"For one , we trained on the standard WSJ training dataset .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O"
11572,"This is a very small training set by neural network standards , as it contains only 40 K sentences ( compared to 60 K examples even in MNIST ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O"
11573,"Still , even training on this set , we managed to get results that match those obtained by domain - specific parsers .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
11574,"To exceed the previous state - of - the - art , we created another , larger training set of 11 M parsed sentences ( 250 M tokens ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11575,"First , we collected all publicly available treebanks .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11576,"We used the OntoNotes corpus version 5 , the English Web Treebank and the updated and corrected Question Treebank .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
11577,Note that the popular Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank is part of the OntoNotes corpus .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
11578,"In total , these corpora give us 90 K training sentences ( we held out certain sections for evaluation , as described below ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11579,"In addition to this gold standard data , we use a corpus parsed with existing parsers using the “ tri - training ” approach of .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O"
11580,"In this approach , two parsers , our reimplementation of BerkeleyParser and a reimplementation of ZPar , are used to process unlabeled sentences sampled from news appearing on the web .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11581,We select only sentences for which both parsers produced the same parse tree and re - sample to match the distribution of sentence lengths of the WSJ training corpus .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O"
11582,Re - sampling is useful because parsers agree much more often on short sentences .,"B,I,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11583,"We call the set of 11 million sentences selected in this way , together with the 90 K golden sentences described above , the high - confidence corpus .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11584,"In earlier experiments , we only used one parser , our reimplementation of BerkeleyParser , to create a corpus of parsed sentences .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11585,In that case we just parsed 7 million senteces from news appearing on the web and combined these parsed sentences with the 90 K golden corpus described above .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11586,We call this the BerkeleyParser corpus .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,O"
11587,subsection : Evaluation,"O,O,O"
11588,We use the standard EVALB tool for evaluation and report F1 scores on our developments set ( section 22 of the Penn Treebank ) and the final test set ( section 23 ) in Table [ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11589,"First , let us remark that our training setup differs from those reported in previous works .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11590,"To the best of our knowledge , no standard parsers have ever been trained on datasets numbering in the hundreds of millions of tokens , and it would be hard to do due to efficiency problems .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
11591,"We therefore cite the semi - supervised results , which are analogous in spirit but use less data .","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11592,Table [ reference ] shows performance of our models on the top and results from other papers at the bottom .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11593,"We compare to variants of the BerkeleyParser that use self - training on unlabeled data , or built an ensemble of multiple parsers , or combine both techniques .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11594,"We also include the best linear - time parser in the literature , the transition - based parser of .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O"
11595,"It can be seen that , when training on WSJ only , a baseline LSTM does not achieve any reasonable score , even with dropout and early stopping .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,O"
11596,But a single attention model gets to and an ensemble of 5 LSTM + A + D models achieves matching a single - model BerkeleyParser on WSJ 23 .,"O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O"
11597,"When trained on the large high - confidence corpus , a single LSTM + A model achieves and so outperforms not only the best single model , but also the best ensemble result reported previously .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11598,An ensemble of 5 LSTM + A models further improves this score to .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11599,paragraph : Generating well - formed trees .,"O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
11600,"The LSTM + A model trained on WSJ dataset only produced malformed trees for 25 of the 1700 sentences in our development set ( % of all cases ) , and the model trained on full high - confidence dataset did this for 14 sentences ( % ) .","O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11601,"In these few cases where LSTM + A outputs a malformed tree , we simply add brackets to either the beginning or the end of the tree in order to make it balanced .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11602,It is worth noting that all 14 cases where LSTM + A produced unbalanced trees were sentences or sentence fragments that did not end with proper punctuation .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11603,"There were very few such sentences in the training data , so it is not a surprise that our model can not deal with them very well .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11604,paragraph : Score by sentence length .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11605,An important concern with the sequence - to - sequence LSTM was that it may not be able to handle long sentences well .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11606,"We determine the extent of this problem by partitioning the development set by length , and evaluating BerkeleyParser , a baseline LSTM model without attention , and LSTM + A on sentences of each length .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11607,"The results , presented in Figure [ reference ] , are surprising .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
11608,"The difference between the F1 score on sentences of length upto 30 and that upto 70 is for the BerkeleyParser , for the baseline LSTM , and for LSTM + A.","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,O,O"
11609,"So already the baseline LSTM has similar performance to the BerkeleyParser , it degrades with length only slightly .","O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O"
11610,"Surprisingly , LSTM + A shows less degradation with length than BerkeleyParser – a full chart parser that uses a lot more memory .","O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

12861,The use of TDSCs promoted a significant reduction in convolutional parameters compared to VDCNN .,"O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O"
12862,"For the most in - depth network evaluated , which contains 29 convolutional layers ( depth 29 ) , the number of parameters of these convolutional layers had a reduction of 66.08 % , from 4.6 to 1.56 million parameters .","O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

12864,The network reduction obtained by the GAP is even more representative since both compared models use three FC layers for their classification tasks .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,O"
12865,"Considering a dataset with four target classes , and comparing SVDCNN with VDCNN , the number of parameters of the FC layers has passed from 12.59 to 0.02 million parameters , representing a reduction of 99.84 % .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

12870,This reduction is a significant result because many embedded platforms have several memory constraints .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"

12922,In order to examine the issue we first need to understand the mechanism behind ResNets .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
12923,Veit et al . have claimed that they actually behave as exponential ensembles of relatively shallow networks .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O"

14193,section : Approach and Model Architecture,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
14194,Historical attempts to scale up GANs using CNNs to model images have been unsuccessful .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14195,This motivated the authors of LAPGAN denton2015deep to develop an alternative approach to iteratively upscale low resolution generated images which can be modeled more reliably .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14196,We also encountered difficulties attempting to scale GANs using CNN architectures commonly used in the supervised literature .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14197,"However , after extensive model exploration we identified a family of architectures that resulted in stable training across a range of datasets and allowed for training higher resolution and deeper generative models .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
14198,Core to our approach is adopting and modifying three recently demonstrated changes to CNN architectures .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14199,"The first is the all convolutional net springenberg2014striving which replaces deterministic spatial pooling functions ( such as maxpooling ) with strided convolutions , allowing the network to learn its own spatial downsampling .","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14201,Second is the trend towards eliminating fully connected layers on top of convolutional features .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14202,The strongest example of this is global average pooling which has been utilized in state of the art image classification models Inceptionism2015 .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O"
14203,We found global average pooling increased model stability but hurt convergence speed .,"O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O"
14204,A middle ground of directly connecting the highest convolutional features to the input and output respectively of the generator and discriminator worked well .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O"
14205,"The first layer of the GAN , which takes a uniform noise distribution as input , could be called fully connected as it is just a matrix multiplication , but the result is reshaped into a 4 - dimensional tensor and used as the start of the convolution stack .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14206,"For the discriminator , the last convolution layer is flattened and then fed into a single sigmoid output .","O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14207,See Fig .,"O,O,O"
14208,[ reference ] for a visualization of an example model architecture .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14209,Third is Batch Normalization ioffe2015batch which stabilizes learning by normalizing the input to each unit to have zero mean and unit variance .,"O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14210,This helps deal with training problems that arise due to poor initialization and helps gradient flow in deeper models .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O"
14211,"This proved critical to get deep generators to begin learning , preventing the generator from collapsing all samples to a single point which is a common failure mode observed in GANs .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"

14213,This was avoided by not applying batchnorm to the generator output layer and the discriminator input layer .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O"
14214,The ReLU activation nair2010rectified is used in the generator with the exception of the output layer which uses the Tanh function .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14215,We observed that using a bounded activation allowed the model to learn more quickly to saturate and cover the color space of the training distribution .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14762,Most bits are in fact about such low level details .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14763,We call this kind of compression – compressing by giving priority to higher levels of representation and generating the remainder –,"O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14764,‘ conceptual compression ’ .,"O,B,I,O,O"

14771,"While the ultimate goal of unsupervised learning remains elusive , we make a step in this direction , and show that our network learns to order information from a rather global level to precise details in images , without being hand - engineered to do this explicitly , as illustrated in Figures [ reference ] and [ reference ] .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14777,These representations need to be combined to get a very sharp distribution at the pixel level if the pixels are modeled independently .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14779,This poses a major challenge .,"O,O,O,O,O,O"

14782,"Thus , sharp reconstructions should not be a property of high - precision values in the network , but should rather be the result of an iterative feedback mechanism that is robust to network parameter change .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14785,Keeping track of the reconstruction aids the iterative feedback mechanism which is learned by back - propagation .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
14786,Computation is both deep – in iterations – and close to the pixels .,"B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14797,subsection : Comparison to Non - variational Models,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I"
14798,"Let us relate this discussion to two other families of generative models , specifically generative adversarial networks ( GANs ; ) and auto - regressive pixel models .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"

14800,"GANs also contain two networks – a generative network that is the same as in variational auto - encoders , and a classification network .","B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14801,The classification network is presented with both real and model - generated images and tries to classify them according to their true nature – real or model - generated .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14803,This makes the generation network produce realistic images that ‘ fool ’ the classification network .,"O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14804,"It needs to produce a wide diversity of images , not just one realistic image , because if it produced only one ( or a small number of them ) , the classification network would classify that image as generated and others as realistic , and be almost always correct .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14807,"So while a given network does n’t produce just one image , it is possible that it produces only a tiny subset of possible realistic images , as it simply competes with the power of the classifier .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
14808,"For example if it generates a sharp image , it is unclear whether the system is also capable of generating its translated version , or simply a slightly distorted version .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14809,"Finally there is another way to get low uncertainty at the pixel level : instead of predicting pixels independently given the latents , we can decide not to use latents and iterate sequentially over the pixels , predicting a given pixel from the previous ones ( from top left to bottom right ) in an autoregressive fashion .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"

14811,The disadvantage is conceptual – the information and decisions are not done at a conceptual level but at the pixel level .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14812,For example when generating cats vs dogs the decisions at the first set of pixels ( top left of the image ) will contain no information about a hypothetical cat or dog .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14815,"However this pixel level approach and our approach are orthogonal and can be easily combined , for example by feeding the output of convolutional DRAW into the conditional computation of a pixel level model .","O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,O"
14816,In this paper we study the latent variable approach and make the pixels independent given the latents .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14817,section : Convolutional DRAW,"O,O,B,I"
14818,In this section we describe the details of a single - layer version of the algorithm .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O"
14819,"Convolutional DRAW contains the following variables : input , reconstruction , reconstruction error , the state of the encoder recurrent net , the state of the decoder recurrent net and latent variable .","B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14822,We use LSTM with convolutional operators instead of the usual linear ones .,"O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14823,The final value of contains the parameters of the input distribution .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14824,For binary images we use the Bernoulli distribution .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14825,"For natural images we use the Gaussian distribution with mean and log variance given by splitting the vector to obtain the input cost and the total cost : where the handling of real valued - ness of the inputs ( [ reference ] , [ reference ] ) is explained below , and being the standard setting .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14826,The algorithm is schematically illustrated in the first layer of Figure [ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14827,The network is trained by calculating the gradient of this loss and using a stochastic gradient descent algorithm .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
14828,Stochastic back - propagation through a sampling function is done as in variational auto - encoders .,"B,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
14829,"Both the approximate posterior and the prior are Gaussian , with mean and log variance being linear functions of or , respectively .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14830,Let us discuss how we handle the input distribution for natural images .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14831,Each pixel ( per color ) is one of 256 values .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14832,We could use a soft - max distribution to model it .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O"
14833,This would result in a rather large output vector at every time step and also does not take advantage of the underlying real valued - ness of intensities and therefore we opted for a Gaussian distribution .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14834,However this still needs to be converted to a discrete distribution over 256 values to calculate the negative likelihood loss .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14835,"Instead of this , we add uniform noise to the input with width corresponding to the spacing between discrete values and calculate where with if inputs are scaled to the interval .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14836,subsection : Multi - layer Architectures,"O,O,B,I,I,I"
14837,Next we explain how we can stack convolutional DRAW with a two layer example .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14838,The first layer is the same as the one just introduced .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14839,"The second layer has the same structure : recurrent encoder , recurrent decoder and a stochastic layer .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O"
14840,The input to the second layer is the mean of the approximate posterior of the first layer .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14841,The output of the second layer biases the prior of the latent variable of the first layer and is also passed as input into the first layer decoder recurrent net .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
14842,This is illustrated in Figure [ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14843,We do n’t use any reconstruction or error in the second layer .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14844,Here we describe a given computational step in detail .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14845,"Indices and denote the variables of layers and , respectively .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14846,"In addition , let be the mean of .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14848,section : Compression,"O,O,B"
14849,Here we show how one can turn variational auto - encoders including convolutional DRAW into compression algorithms .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,O,B,I,O"
14850,"We have not built the actual compressor , however , as we explain , we have strong reasons to believe it would perform as well as calculated here .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14851,Two basic approaches exist .,"O,O,O,O,O"
14852,The first one is less convenient because it needs to add extra data to the bitstream when compressing an image but has essentially a guaranteed compression rate .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
14853,The other one may require some experimentation but is expected to yield a similar compression rate and can be used on a given image without needing extra data .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14854,The underlying compression mechanism for all cases is arithmetic coding .,"O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14855,Arithmetic coding takes as input a sequence of discrete variables and a set of probabilities that predict the variable at time from previous variables .,"B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14856,It then compresses this sequence to bits plus a constant of order one .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14857,Compressing inputs using variational auto - encoders proceeds as follows : discretize each latent variable in each layer using the width of ( eq .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14858,"[ reference ] ) , treat the resulting variables as a sequence with predictions ( eq .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14859,[ reference ] ) and compress using arithmetic coding .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14860,"For this to work as explained , several things are needed .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14861,"First , the discretization should be independent of the input .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14862,This can be achieved by training the network with the variance of being a learned constant that does not depend on the input .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14863,We found that this does not have much effect on the likelihood .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14864,"Second , one should evaluate the log likelihood using this discretization .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14865,One has to decide on the exact manner in which should be computed for each discrete value .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14866,"Significant tuning might be required here , for the obtained likelihoods to be as good as the ones obtained with sampling .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
14867,"However this is likely to be fruitful since there exists a second , less convenient way to compress that is guaranteed to achieve this rate .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14868,This second approach uses bits - back coding .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
14869,We explain only the basic idea here .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14870,We discretize the latents down to a very high level of precision and use to transmit the information .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14871,"Because the discretization precision is high , the probabilities for discrete values are easily assigned .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14872,"That will preserve the information but it will cost many bits , namely where is a probability under that discretization .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14873,"Now , instead of sampling from the approximate posterior when encoding an input , we encode bits of other information into the choice of , that we also want to transmit .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14874,"When is recovered at the receiving end , both the information about the current input and the other information is recovered and thus the information needed to encode the current input is .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14875,"The expectation of this quantity is the KL - divergence in ( [ reference ] ) , which therefore measures the amount of information stored in a given latent layer .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14876,The disadvantage of this approach is that we can not encode a given input without also having some other information we want to transmit .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14877,"However , this coding scheme works even if the variance of the approximate posterior is dependent on the input .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14883,"Occasionally , we find that the cost suddenly increases dramatically .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14912,When compressing the image there is much to be gained in capturing precise correlations between nearby pixels .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14913,There are a lot more bits in these low level details than in the higher level structure that we are actually interested in when learning higher level representations .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"

14972,We present a novel and practical deep fully convolutional neural network architecture for semantic pixel - wise segmentation termed SegNet .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,B,O"

14974,The architecture of the encoder network is topologically identical to the 13 convolutional layers in the VGG16 network .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O"
14975,The role of the decoder network is to map the low resolution encoder feature maps to full input resolution feature maps for pixel - wise classification .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
14976,The novelty of SegNet lies is in the manner in which the decoder upsamples its lower resolution input feature map ( s ) .,"O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

14990,"Semantic segmentation has a wide array of applications ranging from scene understanding , inferring support - relationships among objects to autonomous driving .","B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,B,I,O"
14991,Early methods that relied on low - level vision cues have fast been superseded by popular machine learning algorithms .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
14992,"In particular , deep learning has seen huge success lately in handwritten digit recognition , speech , categorising whole images and detecting objects in images .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,O"

14994,"However , some of these recent approaches have tried to directly adopt deep architectures designed for category prediction to pixel - wise labelling .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,O"
14995,"The results , although very encouraging , appear coarse .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
14996,This is primarily because max pooling and sub - sampling reduce feature map resolution .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,O"
14997,Our motivation to design SegNet arises from this need to map low resolution features to input resolution for pixel - wise classification .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
14998,This mapping must produce features which are useful for accurate boundary localization .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
14999,"Our architecture , SegNet , is designed to be an efficient architecture for pixel - wise semantic segmentation .","O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15000,"It is primarily motivated by road scene understanding applications which require the ability to model appearance ( road , building ) , shape ( cars , pedestrians ) and understand the spatial - relationship ( context ) between different classes such as road and side - walk .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15001,"In typical road scenes , the majority of the pixels belong to large classes such as road , building and hence the network must produce smooth segmentations .","O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15002,The engine must also have the ability to delineate objects based on their shape despite their small size .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15003,Hence it is important to retain boundary information in the extracted image representation .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15004,"From a computational perspective , it is necessary for the network to be efficient in terms of both memory and computation time during inference .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,O"
15005,The ability to train end - to - end in order to jointly optimise all the weights in the network using an efficient weight update technique such as stochastic gradient descent ( SGD ) is an additional benefit since it is more easily repeatable .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15006,The design of SegNet arose from a need to match these criteria .,"O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15007,The encoder network in SegNet is topologically identical to the convolutional layers in VGG16 .,"O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O"
15008,We remove the fully connected layers of VGG16 which makes the SegNet encoder network significantly smaller and easier to train than many other recent architectures .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15009,The key component of SegNet is the decoder network which consists of a hierarchy of decoders one corresponding to each encoder .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15010,"Of these , the appropriate decoders use the max - pooling indices received from the corresponding encoder to perform non - linear upsampling of their input feature maps .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15011,This idea was inspired from an architecture designed for unsupervised feature learning .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15012,"Reusing max - pooling indices in the decoding process has several practical advantages ; ( i ) it improves boundary delineation , ( ii ) it reduces the number of parameters enabling end - to - end training , and ( iii ) this form of upsampling can be incorporated into any encoder - decoder architecture such as with only a little modification .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15013,One of the main contributions of this paper is our analysis of the SegNet decoding technique and the widely used Fully Convolutional Network ( FCN ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O"
15014,This is in order to convey the practical trade - offs involved in designing segmentation architectures .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15015,"Most recent deep architectures for segmentation have identical encoder networks , i.e VGG16 , but differ in the form of the decoder network , training and inference .","O,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O"
15016,Another common feature is they have trainable parameters in the order of hundreds of millions and thus encounter difficulties in performing end - to - end training .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O"
15017,"The difficulty of training these networks has led to multi - stage training , appending networks to a pre - trained architecture such as FCN , use of supporting aids such as region proposals for inference , disjoint training of classification and segmentation networks and use of additional training data for pre - training or for full training .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O"
15018,"In addition , performance boosting post - processing techniques have also been popular .","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15019,"Although all these factors improve performance on challenging benchmarks , it is unfortunately difficult from their quantitative results to disentangle the key design factors necessary to achieve good performance .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15020,We therefore analysed the decoding process used in some of these approaches and reveal their pros and cons .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15021,"We evaluate the performance of SegNet on two scene segmentation tasks , CamVid road scene segmentation and SUN RGB - D indoor scene segmentation .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,O"
15022,Pascal VOC12 has been the benchmark challenge for segmentation over the years .,"B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O"
15023,"However , the majority of this task has one or two foreground classes surrounded by a highly varied background .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15024,This implicitly favours techniques used for detection as shown by the recent work on a decoupled classification - segmentation network where the classification network can be trained with a large set of weakly labelled data and the independent segmentation network performance is improved .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O"
15025,The method of also use the feature maps of the classification network with an independent CRF post - processing technique to perform segmentation .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,O"
15026,"The performance can also be boosted by the use additional inference aids such as region proposals , .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O"
15027,"Therefore , it is different from scene understanding where the idea is to exploit co - occurrences of objects and other spatial - context to perform robust segmentation .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15028,"To demonstrate the efficacy of SegNet , we present a real - time online demo of road scene segmentation into 11 classes of interest for autonomous driving ( see link in Fig .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"

15045,section : Literature Review,"O,O,O,O"
15046,"Semantic pixel - wise segmentation is an active topic of research , fuelled by challenging datasets .","B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15047,"Before the arrival of deep networks , the best performing methods mostly relied on hand engineered features classifying pixels independently .","O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15048,"Typically , a patch is fed into a classifier e.g. Random Forest or Boosting to predict the class probabilities of the center pixel .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15049,Features based on appearance or SfM and appearance have been explored for the CamVid road scene understanding test .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15050,These per - pixel noisy predictions ( often called unary terms ) from the classifiers are then smoothed by using a pair - wise or higher order CRF to improve the accuracy .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,O"
15051,More recent approaches have aimed to produce high quality unaries by trying to predict the labels for all the pixels in a patch as opposed to only the center pixel .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15052,This improves the results of Random Forest based unaries but thin structured classes are classified poorly .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15053,Dense depth maps computed from the CamVid video have also been used as input for classification using Random Forests .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,O"
15054,Another approach argues for the use of a combination of popular hand designed features and spatio - temporal super - pixelization to obtain higher accuracy .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,O"
15055,The best performing technique on the CamVid test addresses the imbalance among label frequencies by combining object detection outputs with classifier predictions in a CRF framework .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O"
15056,The result of all these techniques indicate the need for improved features for classification .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15057,Indoor RGBD pixel - wise semantic segmentation has also gained popularity since the release of the NYU dataset .,"B,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15058,This dataset showed the usefulness of the depth channel to improve segmentation .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15059,"Their approach used features such as RGB - SIFT , depth - SIFT and pixel location as input to a neural network classifier to predict pixel unaries .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15060,The noisy unaries are then smoothed using a CRF .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15061,Improvements were made using a richer feature set including LBP and region segmentation to obtain higher accuracy followed by a CRF .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,O"
15062,"In more recent work , both class segmentation and support relationships are inferred together using a combination of RGB and depth based cues .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15063,"Another approach focuses on real - time joint reconstruction and semantic segmentation , where Random Forests are used as the classifier .","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15064,Gupta et al .,"O,O,O,O"
15065,use boundary detection and hierarchical grouping before performing category segmentation .,"O,B,I,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O"
15066,The common attribute in all these approaches is the use of hand engineered features for classification of either RGB or RGBD images .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,O"
15067,The success of deep convolutional neural networks for object classification has more recently led researchers to exploit their feature learning capabilities for structured prediction problems such as segmentation .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,O"
15068,"There have also been attempts to apply networks designed for object categorization to segmentation , particularly by replicating the deepest layer features in blocks to match image dimensions .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15069,"However , the resulting classification is blocky .","O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O"
15070,Another approach using recurrent neural networks merges several low resolution predictions to create input image resolution predictions .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15071,These techniques are already an improvement over hand engineered features but their ability to delineate boundaries is poor .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15072,Newer deep architectures particularly designed for segmentation have advanced the state - of - the - art by learning to decode or map low resolution image representations to pixel - wise predictions .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,O"
15073,The encoder network which produces these low resolution representations in all of these architectures is the VGG16 classification network which has convolutional layers and fully connected layers .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,O"
15074,This encoder network weights are typically pre - trained on the large ImageNet object classification dataset .,"O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
15075,The decoder network varies between these architectures and is the part which is responsible for producing multi - dimensional features for each pixel for classification .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15076,Each decoder in the Fully Convolutional Network ( FCN ) architecture learns to upsample its input feature map ( s ) and combines them with the corresponding encoder feature map to produce the input to the next decoder .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15077,It is an architecture which has a large number of trainable parameters in the encoder network ( 134 M ) but a very small decoder network ( 0.5 M ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15078,The overall large size of this network makes it hard to train end - to - end on a relevant task .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15079,"Therefore , the authors use a stage - wise training process .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15080,Here each decoder in the decoder network is progressively added to an existing trained network .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15081,The network is grown until no further increase in performance is observed .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15082,This growth is stopped after three decoders thus ignoring high resolution feature maps can certainly lead to loss of edge information .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15083,"Apart from training related issues , the need to reuse the encoder feature maps in the decoder makes it memory intensive in test time .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15084,We study this network in more detail as it the core of other recent architectures .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15085,"The predictive performance of FCN has been improved further by appending the FCN with a recurrent neural network ( RNN ) and fine - tuning them on large datasets , .","O,B,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O"
15086,The RNN layers mimic the sharp boundary delineation capabilities of CRFs while exploiting the feature representation power of FCN ’s .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O"
15087,They show a significant improvement over FCN - 8 but also show that this difference is reduced when more training data is used to train,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15088,FCN - 8 .,"B,I,I,O"
15089,The main advantage of the CRF - RNN is revealed when it is jointly trained with an architecture such as the FCN - 8 .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15090,"The fact that joint training helps is also shown in other recent results , .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15091,"Interestingly , the deconvolutional network performs significantly better than FCN although at the cost of a more complex training and inference .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15092,This however raises the question as to whether the perceived advantage of the CRF - RNN would be reduced as the core feed - forward segmentation engine is made better .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O"
15093,"In any case , the CRF - RNN network can be appended to any deep segmentation architecture including SegNet .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O"
15094,Multi - scale deep architectures are also being pursued .,"B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15095,"They come in two flavours , ( i ) those which use input images at a few scales and corresponding deep feature extraction networks , and ( ii ) those which combine feature maps from different layers of a single deep architecture .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15096,The common idea is to use features extracted at multiple scales to provide both local and global context and the using feature maps of the early encoding layers retain more high frequency detail leading to sharper class boundaries .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15097,Some of these architectures are difficult to train due to their parameter size .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15098,Thus a multi - stage training process is employed along with data augmentation .,"O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15099,The inference is also expensive with multiple convolutional pathways for feature extraction .,"O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O"
15100,Others append a CRF to their multi - scale network and jointly train them .,"O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15101,"However , these are not feed - forward at test time and require optimization to determine the MAP labels .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15102,"Several of the recently proposed deep architectures for segmentation are not feed - forward in inference time , , .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O"
15103,"They require either MAP inference over a CRF , or aids such as region proposals for inference .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O"
15104,We believe the perceived performance increase obtained by using a CRF is due to the lack of good decoding techniques in their core feed - forward segmentation engine .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15105,SegNet on the other hand uses decoders to obtain features for accurate pixel - wise classification .,"B,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
15106,The recently proposed Deconvolutional Network and its semi - supervised variant the Decoupled network use the max locations of the encoder feature maps ( pooling indices ) to perform non - linear upsampling in the decoder network .,"O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,O"
15107,"The authors of these architectures , independently of SegNet ( first submitted to CVPR 2015 ) , proposed this idea of decoding in the decoder network .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O"
15108,"However , their encoder network consists of the fully connected layers from the VGG - 16 network which consists of about of the parameters of their entire network .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15109,This makes training of their network very difficult and thus require additional aids such as the use of region proposals to enable training .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15110,"Moreover , during inference these proposals are used and this increases inference time significantly .","O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O"
15111,"From a benchmarking point of view , this also makes it difficult to evaluate the performance of their architecture ( encoder - decoder network ) without other aids .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15112,In this work we discard the fully connected layers of the VGG16 encoder network which enables us to train the network using the relevant training set using SGD optimization .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15113,"Another recent method shows the benefit of reducing the number of parameters significantly without sacrificing performance , reducing memory consumption and improving inference time .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O"
15114,Our work was inspired by the unsupervised feature learning architecture proposed by Ranzato et al . .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15115,The key learning module is an encoder - decoder network .,"O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
15116,"An encoder consists of convolution with a filter bank , element - wise tanh non - linearity , max - pooling and sub - sampling to obtain the feature maps .","O,B,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15117,"For each sample , the indices of the max locations computed during pooling are stored and passed to the decoder .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15118,The decoder upsamples the feature maps by using the stored pooled indices .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15119,It convolves this upsampled map using a trainable decoder filter bank to reconstruct the input image .,"O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15120,This architecture was used for unsupervised pre - training for classification .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,O"
15121,A somewhat similar decoding technique is used for visualizing trained convolutional networks for classification .,"O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O"
15122,The architecture of Ranzato et al . mainly focused on layer - wise feature learning using small input patches .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15123,This was extended by Kavukcuoglu et .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15124,al .,"O,O"
15125,to accept full image sizes as input to learn hierarchical encoders .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15126,Both these approaches however did not attempt to use deep encoder - decoder networks for unsupervised feature training as they discarded the decoders after each encoder training .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"

15137,"This also reduces the number of parameters in the SegNet encoder network significantly ( from 134 M to 14.7 M ) as compared to other recent architectures , ( see .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

15164,This soft - max classifies each pixel independently .,"O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O"

15203,The upsampled feature map in FCN has channels .,"O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O"

15205,The upsampling kernels are initialized using bilinear interpolation weights .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15206,The FCN decoder model requires storing encoder feature maps during inference .,"O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15207,This can be memory intensive for embedded applications ; for e.g. storing 64 feature maps of the first layer of FCN - Basic at resolution in 32 bit floating point precision takes 11 MB .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

15236,We use median frequency balancing where the weight assigned to a class in the loss function is the ratio of the median of class frequencies computed on the entire training set divided by the class frequency .,"O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15237,This implies that larger classes in the training set have a weight smaller than and the weights of the smallest classes are the highest .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15238,We also experimented with training the different variants without class balancing or equivalently using natural frequency balancing .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15239,subsection : Analysis,"O,O,O"
15240,"To compare the quantitative performance of the different decoder variants , we use three commonly used performance measures : global accuracy ( G ) which measures the percentage of pixels correctly classified in the dataset , class average accuracy ( C ) is the mean of the predictive accuracy over all classes and mean intersection over union ( mIoU ) over all classes as used in the Pascal VOC12 challenge .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15241,The mIoU metric is a more stringent metric than class average accuracy since it penalizes false positive predictions .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15242,"However , mIoU metric is not optimized for directly through the class balanced cross - entropy loss .","O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O"
15243,The mIoU metric otherwise known as the Jacard Index is most commonly used in benchmarking .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15244,"However , Csurka et al . note that this metric does not always correspond to human qualitative judgements ( ranks ) of good quality segmentation .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15245,"They show with examples that mIoU favours region smoothness and does not evaluate boundary accuracy , a point also alluded to recently by the authors of FCN .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15246,Hence they propose to complement the mIoU metric with a boundary measure based on the Berkeley contour matching score commonly used to evaluate unsupervised image segmentation quality .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
15247,Csurka et al . simply extend this to semantic segmentation and show that the measure of semantic contour accuracy used in conjunction with the mIoU metric agrees more with human ranking of segmentation outputs .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15248,The key idea in computing a semantic contour score is to evaluate the F1 - measure which involves computing the precision and recall values between the predicted and ground truth class boundary given a pixel tolerance distance .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15249,We used a value of of the image diagonal as the tolerance distance .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15250,The F1 - measure for each class that is present in the ground truth test image is averaged to produce an image F1 - measure .,"O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15251,"Then we compute the whole test set average , denoted the boundary F1 - measure ( BF ) by average the image F1 measures .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15252,We test each architectural variant after each iterations of optimization on the CamVid validation set until the training loss converges .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,O,O"
15253,With a training mini - batch size of 12 this corresponds to testing approximately every 33 epochs ( passes ) through the training set .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15254,We select the iteration wherein the global accuracy is highest amongst the evaluations on the validation set .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15255,We report all the three measures of performance at this point on the held - out CamVid test set .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15256,"Although we use class balancing while training the variants , it is still important to achieve high global accuracy to result in an overall smooth segmentation .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15257,"Another reason is that the contribution of segmentation towards autonomous driving is mainly for delineating classes such as roads , buildings , side - walk , sky .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15258,These classes dominate the majority of the pixels in an image and a high global accuracy corresponds to good segmentation of these important classes .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O"
15259,We also observed that reporting the numerical performance when class average is highest can often correspond to low global accuracy indicating a perceptually noisy segmentation output .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15260,In Table [ reference ] we report the numerical results of our analysis .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15261,"We also show the size of the trainable parameters and the highest resolution feature map or pooling indices storage memory , i.e , of the first layer feature maps after max - pooling and sub - sampling .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,O"
15262,"We show the average time for one forward pass with our Caffe implementation , averaged over measurements using a input on an NVIDIA Titan GPU with cuDNN v3 acceleration .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,O"
15263,We note that the upsampling layers in the SegNet variants are not optimised using cuDNN acceleration .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15264,We show the results for both testing and training for all the variants at the selected iteration .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15265,The results are also tabulated without class balancing ( natural frequency ) for training and testing accuracies .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
15266,Below we analyse the results with class balancing .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15267,"From the Table [ reference ] , we see that bilinear interpolation based upsampling without any learning performs the worst based on all the measures of accuracy .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15268,All the other methods which either use learning for upsampling ( FCN - Basic and variants ) or learning decoder filters after upsampling ( SegNet - Basic and its variants ) perform significantly better .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15269,This emphasizes the need to learn decoders for segmentation .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O"
15270,This is also supported by experimental evidence gathered by other authors when comparing FCN with SegNet - type decoding techniques .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15271,When we compare SegNet - Basic and FCN,"O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B"
15272,- Basic we see that both perform equally well on this test over all the measures of accuracy .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15273,The difference is that SegNet uses less memory during inference since it only stores max - pooling indices .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15274,On the other hand FCN - Basic stores encoder feature maps in full which consumes much more memory ( 11 times more ) .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15275,SegNet - Basic has a decoder with 64 feature maps in each decoder layer .,"B,I,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15276,"In comparison FCN - Basic , which uses dimensionality reduction , has fewer ( 11 ) feature maps in each decoder layer .","O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15277,This reduces the number of convolutions in the decoder network and hence FCN - Basic is faster during inference ( forward pass ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O"
15278,"From another perspective , the decoder network in SegNet - Basic makes it overall a larger network than FCN - Basic .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15279,This endows it with more flexibility and hence achieves higher training accuracy than FCN - Basic for the same number of iterations .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15280,Overall we see that SegNet - Basic has an advantage over FCN - Basic when inference time memory is constrained but where inference time can be compromised to some extent .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15281,"SegNet - Basic is most similar to FCN - Basic - NoAddition in terms of their decoders , although the decoder of SegNet is larger .","B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O"
15282,"Both learn to produce dense feature maps , either directly by learning to perform deconvolution as in FCN - Basic - NoAddition or by first upsampling and then convolving with trained decoder filters .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15283,"The performance of SegNet - Basic is superior , in part due to its larger decoder size .","O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15284,The accuracy of FCN - Basic - NoAddition is also lower as compared to FCN - Basic .,"O,B,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15285,This shows that it is vital to capture the information present in the encoder feature maps for better performance .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15286,"In particular , note the large drop in the BF measure between these two variants .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15287,This can also explain the part of the reason why SegNet - Basic outperforms FCN - Basic - NoAddition .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15288,The size of the FCN - Basic - NoAddition - NoDimReduction model is slightly larger than SegNet - Basic since the final encoder feature maps are not compressed to match the number of classes .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15289,This makes it a fair comparison in terms of the size of the model .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15290,The performance of this FCN variant is poorer than SegNet - Basic in test but also its training accuracy is lower for the same number of training epochs .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15291,"This shows that using a larger decoder is not enough but it is also important to capture encoder feature map information to learn better , particular the fine grained contour information ( notice the drop in the BF measure ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O"
15292,Here it is also interesting to see that SegNet - Basic has a competitive training accuracy when compared to larger models such FCN - Basic - NoDimReduction .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15293,Another interesting comparison between FCN - Basic - NoAddition and SegNet - Basic - SingleChannelDecoder shows that using max - pooling indices for upsampling and an overall larger decoder leads to better performance .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15294,"This also lends evidence to SegNet being a good architecture for segmentation , particularly when there is a need to find a compromise between storage cost , accuracy versus inference time .","O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O,B,I,O"
15295,"In the best case , when both memory and inference time is not constrained , larger models such as FCN - Basic - NoDimReduction and SegNet - EncoderAddition are both more accurate than the other variants .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15296,"Particularly , discarding dimensionality reduction in the FCN - Basic model leads to the best performance amongst the FCN - Basic variants with a high BF score .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15297,This once again emphasizes the trade - off involved between memory and accuracy in segmentation architectures .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,B,I,O"
15298,The last two columns of Table [ reference ] show the result when no class balancing is used ( natural frequency ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15299,"Here , we can observe that without weighting the results are poorer for all the variants , particularly for class average accuracy and mIoU metric .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,O"
15300,"The global accuracy is the highest without weighting since the majority of the scene is dominated by sky , road and building pixels .","O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15301,"Apart from this all the inference from the comparative analysis of variants holds true for natural frequency balancing too , including the trends for the BF measure .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15302,SegNet - Basic performs as well as FCN - Basic and is better than the larger FCN - Basic - NoAddition - NoDimReduction .,"B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,O"
15303,The bigger but less efficient models FCN - Basic - NoDimReduction and SegNet - EncoderAddition perform better than the other variants .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15304,We can now summarize the above analysis with the following general points .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15305,The best performance is achieved when encoder feature maps are stored in full .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15306,This is reflected in the semantic contour delineation metric ( BF ) most clearly .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O"
15307,"When memory during inference is constrained , then compressed forms of encoder feature maps ( dimensionality reduction , max - pooling indices ) can be stored and used with an appropriate decoder ( e.g. SegNet type ) to improve performance .","O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

15309,section : Benchmarking,"O,O,O"
15310,We quantify the performance of SegNet on two scene segmentation benchmarks using our Caffe implementation .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,O"
15311,The first task is road scene segmentation which is of current practical interest for various autonomous driving related problems .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
15312,The second task is indoor scene segmentation which is of immediate interest to several augmented reality ( AR ) applications .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O"
15313,The input RGB images for both tasks were .,"O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15314,"We benchmarked SegNet against several other well adopted deep architectures for segmentation such as FCN , DeepLab - LargFOV and DeconvNet .","O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,O,B,O"
15315,Our objective was to understand the performance of these architectures when trained end - to - end on the same datasets .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15316,To enable end - to - end training we added batch normalization layers after each convolutional layer .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15317,"For DeepLab - LargeFOV , we changed the max pooling 3 stride to 1 to achieve a final predictive resolution of .","O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O"
15318,We restricted the feature size in the fully connnected layers of DeconvNet to so as to enable training with the same batch size as other models .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15319,Here note that the authors of DeepLab - LargeFOV have also reported little loss in performance by reducing the size of the fully connected layers .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15320,In order to perform a controlled benchmark we used the same SGD solver with a fixed learning rate of and momentum of .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15321,The optimization was performed for more than 100 epochs through the dataset until no further performance increase was observed .,"O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15322,Dropout of was added to the end of deeper convolutional layers in all models to prevent overfitting ( see for example caffe prototxt ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O"
15323,For the road scenes which have classes we used a mini - batch size of and for indoor scenes with classes we used a mini - batch size of .,"O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15324,subsection : Road Scene Segmentation,"O,O,B,I,I"
15325,A number of road scene datasets are available for semantic parsing .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15326,Of these we choose to benchmark SegNet using the CamVid dataset as it contains video sequences .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15327,This enables us to compare our proposed architecture with those which use motion and structure and video segments .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15328,We also combine to form an ensemble of 3433 images to train SegNet for an additional benchmark .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O"
15329,"For a web demo ( see footnote [ reference ] ) of road scene segmentation , we include the CamVid test set to this larger dataset .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O"

15339,The qualitative results show the ability of the proposed architecture to segment smaller classes in road scenes while producing a smooth segmentation of the overall scene .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

15341,DeepLab - LargeFOV is the most efficient model and with CRF post - processing can produce competitive results although smaller classes are lost .,"B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15342,FCN with learnt deconvolution is clearly better than with fixed bilinear upsampling .,"B,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15343,DeconvNet is the largest model and the most inefficient to train .,"B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15344,Its predictions do not retain small classes .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15345,"We also use this benchmark to first compare SegNet with several non deep - learning methods including Random Forests , Boosting in combination with CRF based methods .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15346,This was done to give the user a perspective of the improvements in accuracy that has been achieved using deep networks compared to classical feature engineering based techniques .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"

15348,This shows the ability of the deep architecture to extract meaningful features from the input image and map it to accurate and smooth class segment labels .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15349,"The most interesting result here is the large performance improvement in class average and mIOU metrics that is obtained when a large training dataset , obtained by combining , is used to train SegNet .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15350,"Correspondingly , the qualitative results of SegNet ( see Fig .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15351,[ reference ] ) are clearly superior to the rest of the methods .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15352,It is able to segment both small and large classes well .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15353,We remark here that we used median frequency class balancing in training SegNet - Basic and SegNet .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O"
15354,"In addition , there is an overall smooth quality of segmentation much like what is typically obtained with CRF post - processing .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
15355,"Although the fact that results improve with larger training sets is not surprising , the percentage improvement obtained using pre - trained encoder network and this training set indicates that this architecture can potentially be deployed for practical applications .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15356,Our random testing on urban and highway images from the internet ( see Fig .,"O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15357,[ reference ] ) demonstrates that SegNet can absorb a large training set and generalize well to unseen images .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15358,It also indicates the contribution of the prior ( CRF ) can be lessened when sufficient amount of training data is made available .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O"
15359,In Table [ reference ] we compare SegNet ’s performance with now widely adopted fully convolutional architectures for segmentation .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O"
15360,"As compared to the experiment in Table [ reference ] , we did not use any class blancing for training any of the deep architectures including SegNet .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O"
15361,This is because we found it difficult to train larger models such as DeconvNet with median frequency balancing .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,O"
15362,"We benchmark performance at 40 K , 80 K and 80 K iterations which given the mini - batch size and training set size approximately corresponds to and 100 epochs .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15363,For the last test point we also report the maximum number of iterations ( here atleast 150 epochs ) beyond which we observed no accuracy improvements or when over - fitting set in .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15364,"We report the metrics at three stages in the training phase to reveal how the metrics varied with training time , particularly for larger networks .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15365,This is important to understand if additional training time is justified when set against accuracy increases .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O"
15366,Note also that for each evaluation we performed a complete run through the dataset to obtain batch norm statistics and then evaluated the test model with this statistic ( see for code . ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15367,These evaluations are expensive to perform on large training sets and hence we only report metrics at three time points in the training phase .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15368,"From Table [ reference ] we immediately see that SegNet , DeconvNet achieve the highest scores in all the metrics as compared to other models .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15369,DeconvNet has a higher boundary delineation accuracy but SegNet is much more efficient as compared to DeconvNet .,"B,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15370,This can be seen from the compute statistics in Table [ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15371,"FCN , DeconvNet which have fully connected layers ( turned into convolutional layers ) train much more slowly and have comparable or higher forward - backward pass time with reference to SegNet .","B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15372,"Here we note also that over - fitting was not an issue in training these larger models , since at comparable iterations to SegNet their metrics showed an increasing trend .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15373,For the FCN model learning the deconvolutional layers as opposed to fixing them with bi - linear interpolation weights improves performance particularly the BF score .,"O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15374,It also achieves higher metrics in a far lesser time .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15375,This fact agrees with our earlier analysis in Sec .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15376,[ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O"
15377,"Surprisingly , DeepLab - LargeFOV which is trained to predict labels at a resolution of produces competitive performance given that it is the smallest model in terms of parameterization and also has the fastest training time as per Table [ reference ] .","O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15378,"However , the boundary accuracy is poorer and this is shared by the other architectures .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15379,DeconvNet ’s BF score is higher than the other networks when trained for a very long time .,"B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15380,Given our analysis in Sec .,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
15381,[ reference ] and the fact that it shares a SegNet type architecture .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15382,The impact of dense CRF post - processing can be seen in the last time point for DeepLab - LargeFOV - denseCRF .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15383,Both global and mIoU improve but class average diminshes .,"O,B,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15384,However a large improvement is obtained for the BF score .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15385,Note here that the dense CRF hyperparameters were obtained by an expensive grid - search process on a subset of the training set since no validation set was available .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15386,subsection : SUN RGB - D Indoor Scenes,"O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I"
15387,SUN RGB - D is a very challenging and large dataset of indoor scenes with training and testing images .,"B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,O"
15388,The images are captured by different sensors and hence come in various resolutions .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15389,"The task is to segment indoor scene classes including wall , floor , ceiling , table , chair , sofa etc .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15390,"This task is made hard by the fact that object classes come in various shapes , sizes and in different poses .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15391,There are frequent partial occlusions since there are typically many different classes present in each of the test images .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15392,These factors make this one of the hardest segmentation challenges .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15393,We only use the RGB modality for our training and testing .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15394,Using the depth modality would necessitate architectural modifications / redesign .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15395,Also the quality of depth images from current cameras require careful post - processing to fill - in missing measurements .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15396,They may also require using fusion of many frames to robustly extract features for segmentation .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15397,Therefore we believe using depth for segmentation merits a separate body of work which is not in the scope of this paper .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15398,We also note that an earlier benchmark dataset NYUv2 is included as part of this dataset .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15399,"Road scene images have limited variation , both in terms of the classes of interest and their spatial arrangements .","B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15400,When captured from a moving vehicle where the camera position is nearly always parallel to the road surface limiting variability in view points .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15401,This makes it easier for deep networks to learn to segment them robustly .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15402,"In comparison , images of indoor scenes are more complex since the view points can vary a lot and there is less regularity in both the number of classes present in a scene and their spatial arrangement .","O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15403,Another difficulty is caused by the widely varying sizes of the object classes in the scene .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15404,Some test samples from the recent SUN RGB - D dataset are shown in Fig .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15405,[ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O"
15406,We observe some scenes with few large classes and some others with dense clutter ( bottom row and right ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15407,The appearance ( texture and shape ) can also widely vary in indoor scenes .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15408,"Therefore , we believe this is the hardest challenge for segmentation architectures and methods in computer vision .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15409,"Other challenges , such as Pascal VOC12 salient object segmentation have occupied researchers more , but we believe indoor scene segmentation is more challenging and has more current practical applications such as in AR and robotics .","O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O"
15410,To encourage more research in this direction we compared well known deep architectures on the large SUN RGB - D dataset .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O"
15411,"The qualitative results of SegNet on samples of indoor scenes of different types such as bedroom , living room , laboratory , meeting room , bathroom are shown in Fig .","O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15412,[ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O"
15413,We see that SegNet obtains reasonable predictions when the size of the classes are large under different view points .,"O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15414,This is particularly interesting since the input modality is only RGB .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15415,"RGB images are also useful to segment thinner structures such as the legs of chairs and tables , lamps which is difficult to achieve using depth images from currently available sensors .","B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15416,"This can be seen from the results of SegNet , DeconvNet in Fig .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15417,[ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O"
15418,It is also useful to segment decorative objects such as paintings on the wall for AR tasks .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15419,However as compared to outdoor scenes the segmentation quality is clearly more noisy .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O"
15420,The quality drops significantly when clutter is increased ( see the result sample in the middle column ) .,"O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15421,The quantitative results in Table [ reference ] show that all the deep architectures share low mIoU and boundary metrics .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15422,The global and class averages ( correlates well with mIou ) are also small .,"O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O"
15423,"SegNet outperforms all other methods in terms of G , C , BF metrics and has a slightly lower mIoU than DeepLab - LargeFOV .","B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,O"
15424,As a stand alone experiment we trained SegNet with median frequency class balancing and the metrics were higher ( see Table [ reference ] ) and this agrees with our analysis in Sec .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15425,[ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O"
15426,"Interestingly , using the grid search based optimal hyperparameters for the dense - CRF worsened all except the BF score metric for DeepLab - LargeFOV - denseCRF .","O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15427,More optimal settings could perhaps be found but the grid search process was too expensive given the large inference time for dense - CRFs .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,O"
15428,"One reason for the overall poor performance is the large number of classes in this segmentation task , many of which occupy a small part of the image and appear infrequently .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15429,The accuracies reported in Table [ reference ] clearly show that larger classes have reasonable accuracy and smaller classes have lower accuracies .,"O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
15430,This can be improved with larger sized datasets and class distribution aware training techniques .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
15431,Another reason for poor performance could lie in the inability of these deep architectures ( all are based on the VGG architecture ) to large variability in indoor scenes .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
15432,"This conjecture on our part is based on the fact that the smallest model DeepLab - LargeFOV produces the best accuracy in terms of mIoU and in comparison , larger parameterizations in DeconvNet , FCN did not improve perfomance even with much longer training ( DeconvNet ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O"
15433,This suggests there could lie a common reason for poor performance across all architectures .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15434,More controlled datasets are needed to verify this hypothesis .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15435,section : Discussion and future work,"O,O,O,O,O,O"
15436,Deep learning models have often achieved increasing success due to the availability of massive datasets and expanding model depth and parameterisation .,"B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15437,"However , in practice factors like memory and computational time during training and testing are important factors to consider when choosing a model from a large bank of models .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,O,B,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

15443,a few classes are present in any test image .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
15444,Scene segmentation is more challenging due to the high variability of indoor scenes and a need to segment a larger number of classes simultaneously .,"B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

16286,"Concretely , the encoder processes a source sentence containing words and outputs a sequence of states .","O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16287,"The decoder takes and generates the output sequence left to right , one element at a time .","O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

16365,We consider two search strategies for generating the set of candidate sequences .,"O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16366,"The first is beam search , a greedy breadth - first search that maintains a “ beam ” of the top - scoring candidates at each generation step .","O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

16369,"Whereas beam search focuses on high probability candidates , sampling introduces more diverse candidates ( see comparison in § [ reference ] ) .","O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16370,We also consider both online and offline candidate generation settings in § [ reference ] .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"

16372,"In the offline setting , candidates are generated before training and are never regenerated .","O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16373,Offline generation is also embarrassingly parallel because all samples use the same model .,"B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16374,The disadvantage is that the candidates become stale .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

16376,"Finally , while some past work has added the reference target to the candidate set , i.e. , , we find this can destabilize training since the model learns to assign low probabilities nearly everywhere , ruining the candidates generated by the model , while still assigning a slightly higher score to the reference ( cf . shen2016mrt ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

16588,One of the most interesting approaches consists in jointly training the encoder with both the discriminator and the generator .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,O"

16602,"There are two types of conditional information , and .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16603,The first one is trivially sampled from and is used for training the discriminator with a real image and its associated label .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

16606,Direct interpolation : interpolate between label vectors from the training set Reed2016 .,"B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16607,The reasoning behind this approach is that interpolations can belong to the label distribution .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16608,"Sampling from the training set , : Use directly the real labels from the training set .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

16614,It is not the case of the binary conditional information of the datasets used in this paper ( see section [ reference ] for dataset information ) .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

16646,The goals of this experiment are two .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16647,"First , we evaluate the general performance of the cGAN with an attribute predictor network ( Anet ) on CelebA dataset .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,O,O,B,O,O"

16650,"Inception model , as the output given by this Anet ( i.e. , which attributes are detected on a generated sample ) is a good indicator of the generator ability to model them .","B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16651,"In other words , if the predicted Anet attributes are closer to the original attributes used to generate an image , we expect that the generator has successfully learned the capability to generate new images considering the semantic meaning of the attributes .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16652,"Therefore , we use the generator to create images conditioned on attribute vectors ( i.e. ) , and make the Anet predict them .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
16653,"Using the Anet output , we build a confusion matrix for each attribute and compute the mean accuracy and F1 - Score to test the model and its inserted optimal position of in both generator and discriminator .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"

16663,"On another level , the fact that the generator is able , via an encoder , to reconstruct unseen images from the test set shows that the cGAN is generalizing and suggests that it does not suffer from overfitting , i.e. , it is not just memorizing and reproducing training samples .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

16668,"Furthermore , we can see an interesting property of minimizing a loss based on the latent space instead of a pixel - wise image reconstruction : reconstructed images tend to accurately keep high - level features of an input image ( e.g. how a face generally looks ) in detriment to more local details such as the exact position of the hair , eyes or face .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

17302,"embeddings e ( line "" without CNN - c "" ) is already working well at 28.3 BLEU with a single CNN - a layer and at 29.1 BLEU for CNN - a with 7 layers ( Figure 2a ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17303,Increasing the number of CNN - c layers is beneficial up to three layers and beyond this we did not observe further improvements .,"O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17304,"Similarly , increasing the number of layers in CNN - a beyond six does not increase accuracy on this relatively small dataset .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17305,"In general , choosing two to three times as many layers in CNN - a as in CNN - c is a good rule of thumb .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17306,"Without residual connections , the model fails to utilize the increase in modeling power from additional layers , and performance drops significantly for deeper encoders ( Figure 2b ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17307,"Our convolutional architecture relies on two sets of networks , CNN - a for attention score computation","O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I"

17310,"We found that using the same network for both tasks , similar to recurrent encoders , resulted in poor accuracy of 22.9 BLEU .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,O"
17311,"This compares to 28.5 BLEU for separate singlelayer networks , or 28.3 BLEU when aggregating embeddings for c i .","O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17312,Increasing the number of layers in the single network setup did not help .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17313,Figure 2 ( a ) suggests that the attention weights ( CNN - a ) need to integrate information from a wide context which can be done with a deep stack .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O"
17314,"At the same time , the vectors which are averaged ( CNN - c ) seem to benefit from a shallower , more local representation closer to the input words .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17315,Two stacks are an easy way to achieve these contradicting requirements .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17316,"In Appendix A we visualize attention scores and find that alignments for CNN encoders are less sharp compared to BiLSTMs , however , this does not affect the effectiveness of unknown word replacement once we adjust for shifted maxima .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17317,In Appendix B we investigate whether deep convolutional encoders are required for translating long sentences and observe that even relatively shallow encoders perform well on long sentences .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O"

17321,We do not observe shorter overall training time since SGD converges slower than Adam which we use for BiLSTM models .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,O,O"
17322,We measure generation speed on an Intel Haswell CPU clocked at 2.50GHz with a single thread for BLAS operations .,"O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17323,We use vocabulary selection which can speed up generation by up to a factor of ten at no cost in accuracy via making the time to compute the final output layer negligible,"O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

17325,This shifts the focus from the efficiency of the encoder to the efficiency of the decoder .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
17326,On IWSLT'14 ( Table 3a ) the convolutional encoder increases the speed of the overall model by a factor of 1.35 compared to the BiLSTM encoder while improving accuracy by 0.7 BLEU .,"O,B,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,O"
17327,In this setup both encoders models have the same hidden layer and embedding sizes .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17328,On the larger WMT'15 English - German task ( Table 3b ) the convolutional encoder speeds up generation by 2.1 times compared to a two - layer BiL - STM .,"O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O"
17329,This corresponds to 231 source words / second with beam size 5 .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17330,Our best model on this dataset generates 203 words / second but at slightly lower accuracy compared to the full vocabulary setting in Table 2 .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17331,The recurrent encoder uses larger embeddings than the convolutional encoder which were required for the models to match in accuracy .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"
17332,The smaller embedding size is not the only reason for the speed - up .,"O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

17334,The convolutional encoder is still 1.34x faster ( at 0.7 higher BLEU ) although it requires roughly 1.6x as many FLOPs .,"O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17335,"We believe that this is likely due to better cache locality for convolutional layers on CPUs : an LSTM with fused gates 7 requires two big matrix multiplications with different weights as well as additions , multiplications and non - linearities for each source word , while the output of each convolutional layer can be computed as whole with a single matrix multiply .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

17337,section : Conclusion,"O,O,O"
17338,We introduced a simple encoder model for neural machine translation based on convolutional networks .,"O,O,O,O,B,I,O,B,I,I,O,O,B,I,O"
17339,This approach is more parallelizable than recurrent networks and provides a shorter path to capture long - range dependencies in the source .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
17340,We find it essential to use source position embeddings as well as different CNNs for attention score computation and conditional input aggregation .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,I,O"

17342,"In comparison to other recent work , our deep convolutional encoder is competitive to the best published results to date ( WMT'16 English - Romanian ) which are obtained with significantly more complex models ( WMT'14 English - French ) or stem from improvements that are orthogonal to our work ( WMT'15 English - German ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,O,O"
17343,Our architecture also leads to large generation speed improvements : translation models with our convolutional encoder can translate twice as fast as strong baselines with bi - directional recurrent encoders .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,O,B,I,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O"
