27416524|t|An efficient approach to identify different chemical markers between fibrous root and rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry with multivariate statistical analysis
27416524|a|An ultra high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry approach coupled with multivariate statistical analysis was established and applied to rapidly distinguish the chemical differences between fibrous root and rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides. The datasets of tR-m/z pairs, ion intensity and sample code were processed by principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. Chemical markers could be identified based on their exact mass data, fragmentation characteristics, and retention times. And the new compounds among chemical markers could be isolated rapidly guided by the ultra high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and their definitive structures would be further elucidated by NMR spectra. Using this approach, twenty-four markers were identified on line including nine new saponins and five new steroidal saponins of them were obtained in pure form. The study validated this proposed approach as a suitable method for identification of the chemical differences between various medicinal parts in order to expand medicinal parts and increase the utilization rate of resources.
