28423855|t|EHR Improvement Using Incident Reports
28423855|a|This paper discusses reactive improvement of clinical software using methods for incident analysis. We used the "Five Whys" method because we had only descriptive data and depended on a domain expert for the analysis. The analysis showed that there are two major root causes for EHR software failure, and that they are related to human and organizational errors. A main identified improvement is allocating more resources to system maintenance and user training.
