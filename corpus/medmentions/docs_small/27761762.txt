27761762|t|Sarcoid-like reaction in a patient with uveitis and underlying cancer
27761762|a|Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Occasionally, triggering causes are identified, such as neoplasms, and they are termed sarcoid-like reactions, which may appear in any sarcoidotic target tissue. Choroidal metastases appear as part of widespread metastatic disease or as the first suggestion of neoplastic disease. They can also be a part of the differential diagnosis of a spectrum of inflammatory eye diseases. We present a case in which a lung carcinoma, pulmonary and eye sarcoid-like reactions, and choroidal metastasis take place in the same patient. A 60- year-old male with a past history of pulmonary sarcoidosis and associated anterior uveitis was diagnosed with a lung carcinoma with no regional lymph nodes extension, so that the resection surgery was performed without additional systemic treatment. At the same time, he complained of visual acuity loss and pain in his right eye. An intense ocular inflammatory reaction and a choroidal mass compatible with metastasis were identified. A vitrectomy with an accompanied histological exam of the lesion was deemed inconclusive. Ocular symptoms progressively worsened showing mass growth, and as a result, an enucleation was performed and the histological study subsequently revealed metastasis from his lung carcinoma. Sarcoid-like reactions may be due to incipient malignancies. Any diagnosis of sarcoidosis requires ruling out other diseases that can produce secondary sarcoid-like reactions. In addition, any choroidal mass suggestive of metastasis requires exclusion of metastatic disease even in the absence of clinical signs indicating tumor extension.
