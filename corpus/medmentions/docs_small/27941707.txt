27941707|t|Biological Characteristics of H9N2 Avian Influenza Viruses from Healthy Chickens in Shanghai, China
27941707|a|BACKGROUND H9N2 avian influenza viruses that circulate in domestic poultry in eastern China pose challenges to human health. However, few studies have compared the biological characteristics of H9N2 viruses isolated from healthy chickens in Shanghai. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three H9N2 viruses - CK/SH/Y1/07, CK/SH/Y1/02, and CK/SH/23/13 - isolated from healthy chickens in Shanghai between 2002 and 2013, were selected and their biological characteristics were determined. RESULTS All 3 H9N2 viruses showed a preference for both the avian - and human-like receptors, and they replicated well in MDCK and A549 cells. All H9N2 viruses were non-pathogenic to mini-pigs and were detected in the trachea and lung tissues. The CK/SH/Y1/07 and CK/SH/Y1/02 viruses were transmitted to mini-pigs through direct-contact or respiratory droplet exposure, but CK/SH/23/13 virus was not. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that H9N2 viruses isolated from healthy chickens in Shanghai efficiently replicate and transmit among pigs and other mammals.
