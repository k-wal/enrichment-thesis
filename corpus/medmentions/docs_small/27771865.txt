27771865|t|Habitual physical activity is associated with improved anthropometric and androgenic profile in PCOS: a cross-sectional study
27771865|a|To examine the effect of habitual physical activity (PA) on the metabolic and hormonal profiles of women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Anthropometric, metabolic and hormonal assessment and determination of habitual PA levels with a digital pedometer were evaluated in 84 women with PCOS and 67 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched controls. PA status was defined according to number of steps (â‰¥7500 steps, active, or <7500 steps, sedentary). BMI was lower in active women from both groups. Active PCOS women presented lower waist circumference (WC) and lipid accumulation product (LAP) values versus sedentary PCOS women. In the control group, active women also had lower WC, lower values for fasting and 120-min insulin, and lower LAP than sedentary controls. In the PCOS group, androgen levels were lower in active versus sedentary women (p = 0.001). In the control group, free androgen index (FAI) was also lower in active versus sedentary women (p = 0.018). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and 2000 daily step increments were independent predictors of FAI. Each 2000 daily step increment was associated with a decrease of 1.07 in FAI. Habitual PA was associated with a better anthropometric and androgenic profile in PCOS.
