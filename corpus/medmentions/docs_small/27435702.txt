27435702|t|Long-Term Safety Follow-Up of Subjects Previously Treated with Non-Replicating Retroviral Vector -Based Gene Therapies
27435702|a|Our objective was to evaluate the life-long safety profile of gene therapy using retroviral (non-replicating) vectors (nRCR), or cell products in 127 subjects with hemophilia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or cancer, previously treated with such gene therapy. We assessed the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths and presence of replication competent retrovirus (RCR). A total of 23 subjects remained until the data cut-off date of 31 July 2013 and provided safety information of up to 18 years. Of the 104 subjects who discontinued, the primary reason was loss to follow-up (47.2 %; n = 60). The follow-up period for the 60 subjects lost to follow-up was 7-10 years. A total of 41 subjects experienced at least one SAE, and 15 subjects died. We reviewed SAEs and cause of death (none related to the active therapy), but no evidence was found for safety signals related to new malignancy or neurologic, rheumatological, autoimmune, or hematologic disorder. RCR results were negative, indicating no evidence for in vivo vector persistence. Despite the loss of follow-up, which is the limiting factor in this long-term safety trial, the findings from this long-term follow-up study are encouraging.
