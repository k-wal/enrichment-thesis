27235985|t|Predicting real - world functional milestones in schizophrenia
27235985|a|Schizophrenia is a severe disorder that often causes impairments in major areas of functioning, and most patients do not achieve expected real - world functional milestones. The aim of this study was to identify which variables of demography, illness activity, and functional capacity predict patients ' ability to attain real - world functional milestones. Participants were 235 outpatients, 149 men and 86 women, diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Our results showed that younger patients managed to achieve a higher level of functioning in educational level, marital status, and social contacts. Patients ' functional capacity was primarily associated with educational level and housing situation. We also found that women needed less support regarding housing and obtained a higher level of marital status as compared with men. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering current symptoms, especially negative symptoms, and remission stability over time, together with age, duration of illness, gender, educational level, and current functional capacity, when predicting patients ' future real - world functioning. We also conclude that there is an advantage in exploring symptoms divided into positive, negative, and general domains considering their probable impact on functional achievements.
