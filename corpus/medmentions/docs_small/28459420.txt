28459420|t|Is Total Elbow Arthroplasty Safe as an Outpatient Procedure?
28459420|a|Ambulatory surgery centers are the preferred setting for many procedures formerly performed in a hospital setting. This study sought to determine whether outpatient total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) is as safe as inpatient TEA. A retrospective analysis was performed of inpatient (IP) versus outpatient (OP) TEA by a single surgeon over a period of 18 years. Demographic, social, and comorbidity measures as well as complication rates were analyzed and stratified by IP or OP status. Bivariate comparison showed increased prevalence of coronary artery disease in the OP group (32% vs. 7%) and increased age in the IP group (68 years vs. 58 years). All other demographic, social, and comorbidity factors were comparable between the IP and OP groups, although more infections were seen in the IP group. The surgeons' initial learning curve occurred mostly within the IP group. Most important, no difference in complication rate was observed between the IP and OP groups.
