27312275|t|Toxicity assessment of water-accommodated fractions from two different oils using a zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo - larval bioassay with a multilevel approach
27312275|a|Petroleum compounds from chronic discharges and oil spills represent an important source of environmental pollution. To better understand the deleterious effects of these compounds, the toxicity of water-accommodated fractions (WAF) from two different oils (brut Arabian Light and Erika heavy fuel oils) were used in this study. Zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio) were exposed during 96 h at three WAF concentrations (1, 10 and 100% for Arabian Light and 10, 50 and 100% for Erika) in order to cover a wide range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations, representative of the levels found after environmental oil spills. Several endpoints were recorded at different levels of biological organization, including lethal endpoints, morphological abnormalities, photomotor behavioral responses, cardiac activity, DNA damage and exposure level measurements (EROD activity, cyp1a and PAH metabolites). Neither morphological nor behavioral or physiological alterations were observed after exposure to Arabian Light fractions. In contrast, the Erika fractions led a high degree of toxicity in early life stages of zebrafish. Despite of defense mechanisms induced by oil, acute toxic effects have been recorded including mortality, delayed hatching, high rates of developmental abnormalities, disrupted locomotor activity and cardiac failures at the highest PAH concentrations (∑TPAHs=257,029±47,231ng·L(-1)). Such differences in toxicity are likely related to the oil composition. The use of developing zebrafish is a good tool to identify wide range of detrimental effects and elucidate their underlying foundations. Our work highlights once more, the cardiotoxic action (and potentially neurotoxic) of petroleum -related PAHs.
