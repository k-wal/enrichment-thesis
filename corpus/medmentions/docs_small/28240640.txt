28240640|t|Comparison of 270 Versus 320 mg I/mL of Iodixanol in 1 Image Assessment of Both Renal Arteries and Veins With Dual-Energy Spectral CT Imaging in Late Arterial Phase and Their Influence on Renal Function
28240640|a|The objective of this study was to compare the image quality of renal arteries and veins with dual-energy spectral computed tomography (CT) imaging in late arterial phase using 270 and 320 mg I/mL of iodixanol and their influence on renal function. A total of 1062 patients underwent renal CT angiography with 270 or 320 mg I/mL of iodixanol with dual-energy spectral CT imaging in late arterial phase. Image quality and their influence on renal function were compared. There were no significant differences of CT value, signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and subjective score of renal vessels between 2 groups (all P > 0.05). The incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with abnormal renal function using 320 mg I/mL of iodixanol was significantly higher than using 270 mg I/mL of iodixanol (P = 0.043). The renal arteries and veins can be fully assessed in late arterial phase with 270 mg I/mL of iodixanol using dual-energy spectral CT scan with better preserved renal function.
