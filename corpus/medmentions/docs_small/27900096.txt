27900096|a|A 60-year-old female visited Guihang Guiyang Hospital (Guiyang, China). She presented with abdominal pain in the right side for the previous 2-months, with a touchable mass identified for the previous 1-month. Computed tomography with magnetic resonance imaging revealed a huge mass in the right abdomen. The diagnosis of well-differentiated retroperitoneal liposarcoma with renal involvement was made. During surgery, the tumor was removed, including the fatty renal capsule; however, the kidney was preserved. It is currently debatable whether resection of adjacent organs is required to obtain the negative margins. Conventional viewpoints advise that multi-organ resection is required in order to obtain the negative-margin. However, even if an R0 resection is achieved, the local recurrence rate remains markedly high. Additionally, the complications of organ resection have more impact on patients. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are an important adjuvant method for these patients. In conclusion, retroperitoneal liposarcoma is a rare disease with a high rate of recurrence. Complete resection is the predominant treatment; however, combined resection of adjacent organs must be considered.
