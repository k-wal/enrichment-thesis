27826087|a|to evaluate role of three-dimensional constructive interference in steady-state (3D-CISS) sequences and phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) in patients with arrested hydrocephalus. Prospective study was conducted on 20 patients with arrested hydrocephalus. All patients underwent PC-MRI and 3D-CISS for assessment of the aqueduct. Axial (through-plane), sagittal (in-plane) PC-MRI and sagittal 3D-CISS were applied to assess the cerebral aqueduct and the spontaneous third ventriculostomy if present. Aqueductal patency was graded using 3D-CISS and PC-MRI. Quantitative analysis of flow through the aqueduct was done using PC-MRI. The causes of obstruction were aqueductal obstruction in 75% (n=15), 3rd ventricular obstruction in 5% (n=1) and 4th ventricular obstruction in 20 % (n=4). The cause of arrest of hydrocephalus was spontaneous third ventriculostomy in 65% (n=13), endoscopic third ventriculostomy in 10% (n=2), ventriculo-peritoneal shunt in 5% (n=1) and no cause could be detected in 20% of patients (n=4). There is a positive correlation (r= 0.80) and moderate agreement (κ= 0.509) of grading with PC-MRI and 3D-CISS sequences. The mean peak systolic velocity of CSF was 1.86 ± 2.48 cm/sec, the stroke volume was 6.43 ± 13.81μl/cycle, and the mean flow was 0.21 ± 0.32 ml/min. We concluded that 3D-CISS and PC-MRI are non-invasive sequences for diagnosis of the level and cause of arrested hydrocephalus.
