28024592|a|This study aims to establish a facile protocol for the preparation of a bi-layered poly(glycerol-sebacate) (PGS)/ β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) construct and to investigate its potential for bone-soft tissue engineering applications. The layered structure was prepared by distributing the ceramic particles within a prepolymer synthesized in a microwave reactor followed by a cross-linking of the final construct in vacuum (<10mbar). The vacuum stage led to the separation of cross-linked elastomer (top) and ceramic (bottom) phases. Results showed that addition of β-TCP particles to the elastomer matrix after the polymerization led to an increase in compression strength (up to 14±2.3MPa). Tensile strength (σ), Young's modulus (E), and elongation at break (%) values were calculated as 0.29±0.03MPa and 0.21±0.03; 0.38±0.02 and 1.95±0.4; and 240±50% and 24±2% for PGS and PGS / β-TCP bi-layered constructs, respectively. Morphology was characterized by using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and micro-computed tomography (μ-CT). Tomography data revealed an open porosity of 35% for the construct, mostly contributed from the ceramic phase since the elastomer side has no pore. Homogeneous β-TCP distribution within the elastomeric structure was observed. Cell culture studies confirmed biocompatibility with poor elastomer - side and good bone - side cell attachment. In a further study to investigate the osteogenic properties, the construct were loaded with BMP-2 and/or TGF-β1. The PGS / β-TCP bi-layered constructs with improved mechanical and biological properties have the potential to be used in bone-soft tissue interface applications where soft tissue penetration is a problem.
