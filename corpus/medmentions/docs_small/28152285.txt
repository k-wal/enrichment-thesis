28152285|a|In an interview with Fresenius Medical Care chief medical officer Frank Maddux, MD in the July issue of NN&l ("CMO looks at ways to put meaning behind 'quality care'"), we asked Dr. Maddux if he believed that patients wanted more engagement at home via telehealth with their caregivers. His response should have read, 'For many of our patients, it's not about diagnosing the disease. It is about preventing the known crises events from occurring ." The original printed response had read, "...it is about preventing the non-crisis events from occurring ."
