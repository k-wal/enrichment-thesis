27847809|a|Neuroblastoma is one of the most malignant solid tumors in infants and young children. No more than 40% of neuroblastoma patients can survive for longer than five years after it has been diagnosed. XPC protein is a pivotal factor that recognizes DNA damage and starts up the nucleotide excision repair (NER) in mammalian cells. This makes up the first group to defend against the cancer. Previous studies have identified that XPC gene polymorphisms were associated with various types of cancer. However, the associations between XPC gene polymorphisms and neuroblastoma risk have not yet been studied. We investigated the associations between three XPC gene polymorphisms (rs2228001 A>C, rs2228000 C>T, and rs2229090 G>C) and neuroblastoma risk with 256 neuroblastoma patients and 531 healthy controls in a Chinese Han population. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to access the association between these three polymorphisms and neuroblastoma risk. No significant association was detected between these three polymorphisms and neuroblastoma risk in the overall analysis as well as in the stratification analysis. These results suggest that none of these three polymorphisms may be associated with the risk of neuroblastoma in the Chinese Han population.
