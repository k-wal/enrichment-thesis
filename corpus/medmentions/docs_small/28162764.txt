28162764|a|Gastrojejunostomy tubes (GJTs) enable enteral nutrition in infants / children with feeding intolerance. However, complications may be increased in small infants. We evaluated our single-institution GJT complication rate and systematically reviewed existing literature. With REB approval, a retrospective single-institution analysis of GJT placements between 2009 and 2015 was performed. For the systematic review, MOOSE guidelines were followed. At our institution, 48 children underwent 154/159 successful insertions primarily for gastroesophageal reflux (n=27; 55%) and aspiration (n=11; 23%). Median age at first GJT insertion was 2.2years (0.2-18). Thirty-five (73%) had an index insertion when ≤10kg. GJTs caused 2 perforations and 1 death. The systematic review assessed 48 articles representing 2726 procedures. Overall perforation rate was estimated as 2.1% (n=36 studies, 23/1092, 95% CI: 1.0-3.2). Perforation rates in children <10kg versus ≥10kg were estimated as 3.1%/ procedure (95% CI: 1.1%-5.0%) and 0.1%/ procedure (95% CI: 0%-0.3%), respectively. The relative risk of perforation was 9.4 (95% CI: 2.8-31.3). Overall mortality was estimated as 0.9%/ patient (n=39 studies; 95% CI: 0.2-1.6%). Most perforations (19/23; 83%) occurred ≤30days of attempted tube placement. Gastrojejunostomy tubes are associated with significant complications and frequently require revision/replacement. Insertion in patients <10kg is associated with increased perforation risk. Caution is warranted in this subgroup. Level II.
