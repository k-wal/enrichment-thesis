27295294|t|Smart Thin Hydrogel Coatings Harnessing Hydrophobicity and Topography to Capture and Release Cancer Cells
27295294|a|Smart thin hydrogel coatings are fabricated to capture and release targeted cancer cells by simultaneously tuning surface hydrophobicity and topography. At physiological temperature, the targeted cancer cells are capture d on the hydrophobic and wrinkled coating surface. At room temperature, the captured cells are released from the hydrophilic and smooth coating surface.
