28349200|a|Ecological traits that reflect movement potential are often used as proxies for measured dispersal distances. Whether such traits reflect actual dispersal is often untested. Such tests are important because maximum dispersal distances may not be achieved and many dispersal events may be unsuccessful (without reproduction). For insects, many habitat patches harbour ' resident ' species that are present as larvae (sedentary) and adults (winged and dispersing), and ' itinerant ' species present only as adults that have dispersed from elsewhere and fail to reproduce. We tested whether itinerancy patterns were temporally consistent, and whether itinerant and resident species differed in wing morphology, a strong correlate of flight capability. Over 3 years and at multiple locations in a 22 km stream length, we sampled larvae and adults of caddisflies in the genus Ecnomus to categorize species as residents or itinerants. Flight capacity was measured using wing size (length and area) and shape parameters (aspect ratio and the second moment of wing area). Three species of Ecnomus were residents and three species were itinerants, and patterns were consistent over 3 years. On average, itinerant species had larger wings, suggesting a greater capacity to fly long distances. Wing shape differed between species, but did not differ systematically between residents and itinerants. Wing morphology was associated with actual but not effective dispersal of some species of Ecnomus. Morphological traits may have weak explanatory power for hypotheses regarding the demographic connectedness of populations, unless accompanied by data demonstrating which dispersers contribute new individuals to populations.
