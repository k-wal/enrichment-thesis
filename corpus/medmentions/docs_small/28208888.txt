28208888|a|Prevalence of haemoglobinopathies and β-thalassaemia are very high in India but information about its status among the tribals working in the tea gardens of Assam is very less. The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence of haemoglobinopathies and β-thalassaemia among the tribals working in the tea gardens of Assam. A total 1204 samples from the tribals working in tea gardens of Assam were analysed for both Complete Blood Count (CBC) and High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) for detection of haemoglobinopathies and β-thalassaemia. This study showed that the prevalence of sickle cell anaemia and β-thalassaemia were very high among this population. Our results indicated a higher prevalence of β-thalassaemia (3.07%) among the Munda ethnic group and higher prevalence of sickle cell anaemia (4.73%) among the Lohar ethnic group. This was the first study to report the presence of HbE among the tribals working in the tea gardens of Assam. Based on the present findings, sickle cell anaemia and β-thalassaemia were major health problem for the tribals working in the tea gardens of Assam. Proper diagnostic facilities for haemoglobinopathy and thalassaemia should be established in these areas, including establishment of haemoglobinopathy and thalassaemia database collection, haematological analysis laboratories, genetic counselling clinics, prenatal diagnosis centres and neonatal screening centres.
