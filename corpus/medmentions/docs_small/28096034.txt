28096034|a|To investigate the effect of having a contract for self-referral to inpatient treatment (SRIT) in patients with severe mental disorders. A randomized controlled trial with 53 adult patients; 26 participants received a SRIT contract, which they could use to refer themselves into a Community Mental Health Centre up to five days for each referral without contacting a doctor in advance. Outcomes were assessed after 12 months with the self-report questionnaires Patient Activation Measure (PAM-13), Recovery Assessment Scale (RAS), and the Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale (BASIS-32) and analyzed using linear mixed and regression models. There was no significant effect on PAM-13 (estimated mean difference (emd) -0.41, 95% CI (CI):-7.49-6.67), nor on the RAS (emd 0.02, CI:-0.27-0.31) or BASIS-32 (0.09, CI:-0.28-0.45). An exploratory post hoc analysis showed effect of SRIT in those with low PAM below â‰¤47 (p=0.049). There were no group differences after 12 months, but both groups maintained their baseline levels. SRIT contracts can be recommended as it supports the rights to self-determination, promote user participation in decision-making in own treatment without any indication of adverse effects.
