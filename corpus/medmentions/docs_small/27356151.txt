27356151|t|Cavity partition and functionalization of a [2+3] organic molecular cage by inserting polar P[double bond, length as m-dash]O bonds
27356151|a|The cavity of a [2+3] organic molecular cage was partitioned and functionalized by inserting inner-directed P[double bond, length as m-dash]O bonds, which shows CO2 capture and CH4 exclusion due to the size - matching and polarity effects. Computational results demonstrate that the successful segmentation via polar P[double bond, length as m-dash]O bonds facilitates the CO2 molecules to reside selectively inside the cavity.
