28424986|t|Extremely Giant Liver Hemangioma (50 cm) with Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome
28424986|a|A 33- year - old male has been found with a giant liver hemangioma of initial size 29 cm for 5 years. He received arterial embolization twice in order to shrink the tumor; however, no effect was obtained. The tumor had rapidly grown to 50 cm and caused abnormalities in the hematological and coagulative systems. Preoperative computed tomography revealed that the right hepatic vein, right hepatic artery, and right portal vein were not involved by the hemangioma. Resection of the giant liver hemangioma was successfully performed after intraoperative intentional bloodletting with concurrent blood salvage. All hematological and coagulative abnormalities had returned to normal after the procedure.
