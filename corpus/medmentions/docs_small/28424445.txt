28424445|t|Management of tachyarrhythmia during pregnancy
28424445|a|Maternal tachyarrhythmia is a common complication during pregnancy due to hormonal changes that enhance pre-existing arrhythmias or induce new arrhythmias in the presence of congenital heart defects in pregnant females. Presence of tachyarrhythmia during pregnancy poses risk to the mother and fetus, calling for proper treatment with medications. Use of antiarrhythmic drugs in cases of maternal tachyarrhythmia must give due consideration of potential teratogenic side effects. Utilization of antiarrhythmic drugs during pregnancy has been well studied; some result in minimal fetal harm or none at all. New techniques, such as cardiac ablation, have also been implemented with minimal or no radiation exposure to the fetus or mother. Pregnant women with tachyarrhythmia have been successfully treated with little to no impact on the developing fetus as result of increasing experience with antiarrhythmic drugs and progress of new procedural techniques.
