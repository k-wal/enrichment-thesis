28544215|t|Anterior single implants with different neck designs: 5 Year results of a randomized clinical trial
28544215|a|The design of the implant neck might be significant for preservation of marginal bone. To compare the 5-year radiographic and clinical outcome of single anterior implants provided with a smooth neck, a rough neck or a scalloped rough neck. 93 Patients with a missing anterior tooth in the maxilla were included. At random, patients received an implant with a 1.5 mm smooth neck (" smooth group "), a rough neck with grooves (" rough group ") or a scalloped rough neck with grooves (" scalloped group "). Implants were installed in healed sites. Follow-up visits were conducted after final crown delivery and 1 year and 5 years later. Scalloped implants showed significantly more initial marginal bone resorption. The total amount of bone loss was 1.26 ± 0.90 mm in the smooth group, 1.20 ± 1.1 mm in the rough group and 2.28 ± 0.97 mm in the scalloped group (P < .05). Survival rates were 96.2% for the smooth and scalloped group and 100% for the rough group. Scalloped implants showed deeper pocket depths, more bleeding and more technical complications. There were no differences in esthetic outcome nor in patient satisfaction. For anterior single tooth replacements, scalloped implants show less favorable radiographic and clinical outcome compared to regular implants with a smooth neck or rough neck.
