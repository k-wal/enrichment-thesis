27998307|a|Behcet's disease is a heterogeneous, multisystem, inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. The classic triad of oral and genital ulcerations in conjunction with uveitis was originally described by the Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Behcet in 1937, but associated symptoms of the cardiovascular, central nervous, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal systems were later identified. In fact, Behcet's disease with neurological involvement (neuro-Behcet's disease) is not uncommon. Patients with neuro-Behcet's disease typically exhibit a diverse array of symptoms, most commonly in the brainstem and diencephalic regions. Herein, we report an unusual case of neuro-Behcet's disease in a patient who presented with a solitary cerebellar hemorrhage. A 39-year-old Asian woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of a sudden speech difficulty that had manifested the same morning, and dizziness and mild vomiting experienced over the previous 3 days. Magnetic resonance images revealed target-like hemorrhagic lesions in the right hemisphere of the cerebellum. Risk factors that may result in cerebellar hemorrhage, such as high blood pressure or bleeding diathesis, were ruled out, and subsequent brain angiograms were normal. These findings suggest that the patient's cerebellar hemorrhage could have been due to intracranial vasculitis in a rare, if not unique, complication of neuro-Behcet's disease.
