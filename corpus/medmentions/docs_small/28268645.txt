28268645|t|Effect of temperature on sleep regulation in an animal epilepsy model
28268645|a|Besides recurring seizures, disordered sleep is common in individuals with epilepsy and may present as reduced sleep depth, altered proportions of different stages of sleep, intermittent arousal, and other phenomena. Sleep loss can in turn precipitate seizures, thus sustaining a vicious cycle. It is well known that changes in ambient temperature elicit thermoregulatory responses that alter the dynamics of sleep. As a first step toward therapeutic sleep modulation for epilepsy, we assessed the effect of elevated ambient temperature on sleep dynamics and seizure yield in the chronic pilocarpine mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The results in a small sample indicate that temperature does in fact significantly alter the proportions and durations of each vigilance state in this model, with possibly correlated changes in seizure incidence. Manipulation of ambient temperature therefore offers a simple and relatively unobtrusive way of titrating sleep quality and perhaps alleviating the seizure burden in epilepsy.
