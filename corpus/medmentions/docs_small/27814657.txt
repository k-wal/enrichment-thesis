27814657|t|Understanding ligand-receptor non-covalent binding kinetics using molecular modeling
27814657|a|Kinetic properties may serve as critical differentiators and predictors of drug efficacy and safety, in addition to the traditionally focused binding affinity. However the quantitative structure-kinetics relationship (QSKR) for modeling and ligand design is still poorly understood. This review provides an introduction to the kinetics of drug binding from a fundamental chemistry perspective. We focus on recent developments of computational tools and their applications to non-covalent binding kinetics.
