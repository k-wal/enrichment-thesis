28421810|a|Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a safe procedure and major morbidity is unusual. However, the number of PEG fed patients is increasing all over the world and complications may become more and more frequent. We describe a 73 years old woman with persistent vomit after replacement of the standard PEG tube with a Foley catheter. An upper GI endoscopy showed the catheter pulled into the duodenum causing gastric outlet obstruction. It was removed and replaced by a suitable standard PEG tube, allowing PEG feeding to be resumed. Previous reports pointed the risk of this complication, almost always associated with insertion of a Foley-type catheter. Replacement of PEG tubes should be performed by experienced teams using standard PEG tubes and the use of Foley-type catheters for this purpose should be banned from routine practice.
