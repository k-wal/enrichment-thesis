27431445|a|Stingless bee s have evolved several ways to share contested resources to ensure the coexistence between different species. Partamona orizabaensis quickly exploits food sources by fast and direct recruitment that does not rely on scent marks deposited on substrates. In this study we show that the flight activity of P. orizabaensis is influenced by weather conditions, with higher activity during periods of colder temperatures, higher relative humidity and even during rainfall. We showed that the outcome of aggression experiments between the non-aggressive species P. orizabaensis and its aggressive competitor Trigona fuscipennis is influenced by the number of bees that arrive early after food source discovery. Therefore, the increased activity during less favorable weather conditions and the fast recruitment of nestmates following the discovery of a food source, as observed for P. orizabaensis, may be adaptations that evolved to coexist even with more aggressive and dominant species of stingless bees, with which P. orizabaensis has to compete for resources.
