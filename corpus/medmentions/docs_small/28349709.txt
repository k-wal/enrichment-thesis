28349709|t|Meeting Report
28349709|a|On July 6 and 7, 2016 the Fourth Artificial Pancreas Workshop: Testing and Adoption of Current and Emerging Technologies was held on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Campus at the Lister Hill Auditorium. The meeting was sponsored by a group of governmental organizations and NGOs, listed in Appendix A. This was a very timely meeting as the artificial pancreas appears to be growing from academic studies to commercial projects. The first artificial pancreas may be marketed within 12 months and a few may be approved within 24 months. The NIH, the FDA, the JDRF, Helmsley Trust, Diabetes Technology Society, and other agencies, funders, and organizations have been strongly supportive of advancing artificial pancreas technology and usability, and thus the proceedings from this conference should be of exceptional interest to the diabetes technology community.
