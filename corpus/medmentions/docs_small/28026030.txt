28026030|t|Evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function profile in patients with pulmonary hypertension due to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
28026030|a|Echocardiography plays an important role in the diagnostic work up of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). We sought to determine the left ventricular (LV) diastolic profile by echocardiography in patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to PH-HFpEF. The study of LV diastolic function by echocardiography has limitations in patients with HFpEF and PH, and certain LV diastolic determinations convey a worse prognosis. We included patients with postcapillary PH and diagnosis of PH-HFpEF. Investigators reviewed Doppler echocardiograms completed within 3 months of the diagnostic right heart catheterization. We included 149 patients with a mean ± standard deviation age of 63 ± 14 years; 58% were women. LV diastolic function profile was determined as normal (41%), grade I (34%), and grade II and grade III (25%). Pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance were higher and cardiac output lower in patients with LV diastolic dysfunction profile; however, pulmonary artery wedge pressure was not significantly different among grades of LV diastolic function. Although there was an association between the presence of LV diastolic dysfunction profile and long-term survival (P = 0.03), it disappeared when adjusting for age and gender. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction, paradoxical septal motion, and higher RV systolic pressure remained the only variables significantly associated with poor survival. The profile of LV diastolic dysfunction by conventional echocardiography is highly variable in patients with PH-HFpEF and has no significant impact on long-term survival. A more severe RV function and higher right ventricle systolic pressure were associated with worse survival.
