27289224|t|Molecular characterization of a novel putative ampelovirus tentatively named grapevine leafroll-associated virus 13
27289224|a|A novel putative ampelovirus was detected in grapevines that showed typical leafroll symptoms and was tentatively named grapevine leafroll-associated virus (GLRaV)-13 following the series of numbering of other GLRaVs. The complete genome of GLRaV-13 comprised 17,608 nt and contained eleven putative open reading frames, showing genetic features similar to those of viruses belonging to subgroup I of genus Ampelovirus. Phylogenetic trees based on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, heat shock protein 70 homolog, and coat protein showed that GLRaV-13 had the closest, but still distant, relationship to GLRaV-1 in the subgroup I cluster.
