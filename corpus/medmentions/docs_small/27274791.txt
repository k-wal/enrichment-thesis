27274791|t|Comparing Time Perception among Morphine - Derived Drugs Addicts and Controls
27274791|a|The aim of the present study is to compare time perception among drug addicts and controls. 30 drug addicts were selected, and 30 non-addict individuals were selected as the control group. The two groups performed three tests of time reproduction, time estimation, and time discrimination. There was a significant difference between the addicts group and the control group regarding the error of time reproduction and time estimation. The addict group in comparison to the control group had a lower under- reproduction and a higher over- reproduction error, and also a lower under- estimation and higher over- estimation error. However, regarding time discrimination, no significant difference was observed between the errors committed by both groups. On the other hand, when showing images of drug consumption tools and normal images with same durations, the normal group believed that the images related to drug consumption tools were shown for a shorter period of time. Time perception is different between morphine - derived drugs addicts and controls.
