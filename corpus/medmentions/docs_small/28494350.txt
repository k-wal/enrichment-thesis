28494350|t|Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantification of acetamiprid and thiacloprid residues in butterbur grown under regulated conditions
28494350|a|An analytical method was developed to quantify the residual levels of the neonicotinoid insecticides, acetamiprid and thiacloprid, in field-incurred butterbur samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Samples were extracted with acetonitrile and partitioned with dichloromethane. After partitioning, purification was conducted using a Florisil(®) cartridge. Linearity of a matrix-matched calibration curve of the two compounds over a concentration range of 0.004-0.4μg/g was excellent, with determination coefficients (R(2))≥0.9998. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for both acetamiprid and thiacloprid were 0.0006 and 0.002mg/kg, respectively. The average recoveries for acetamiprid and thiacloprid at two spiking levels (0.02 and 0.1mg/kg, i.e., 10× LOQ and 50× LOQ) were between 78.23 to 82.17%, with relative standard deviations (RSDs)≤7.22%. The method was successfully applied to field-incurred samples treated with a commercial pesticide product, either once (zero or 7 days before harvest) or twice (0 and 7, 7 and 14, or 14 and 21 days before harvest). The highest and lowest residues were obtained for the 7 and 0 days ' treatment and the 21 and 14 days ' treatment, respectively. The developed method is simple and accurate and can be extrapolated to other leafy vegetables.
