28437199|t|The Correlation of Arterial Stiffness with Biophysical Parameters and Blood Biochemistry
28437199|a|Type 2 diabetes presents with numerous macrovascular and microvascular impairments, which in turn lead to various co-morbidities. Vascular co-morbidities can be seen when examining arterial stiffness (AS), which is a predictor for endothelial health and cardiovascular disease risk. Pulse wave analysis (PWA) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) are two tests that are commonly used to measure AS. Currently, disease states and progression are tracked via blood biochemistry. These gold standards in monitoring diabetes are expensive and need optimization. To investigate which biophysical and biochemical parameters correlated best with AS, which may reduce the number of biochemical tests and biophysical parameter measurements needed to track disease progression. Data from 42 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus for â‰¤10 years, aged 40-70 years, were analyzed at a single time point. We investigated various blood biochemistry, body composition, and AS parameters. A combination of fat mass and fat-free mass was most associated with PWA over any other parameters. Leptin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein seem to be the next two parameters that correlate with augmentation index. No other parameters had strong correlations to either PWA or PWV values. Body composition methods seemed to be better predictors of type 2 diabetes mellitus patient's vascular disease progression. Our study indicates that body composition measurements may help replace expensive tests. This may have public health and health surveillance implications in countries facing financial challenges.
