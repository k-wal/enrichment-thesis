28315127|t|Inherited Ventricular Arrhythmias: The Role of the Multi-Subunit Structure of the L-Type Calcium Channel Complex
28315127|a|The normal heartbeat is conditioned by transient increases in the intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration. Ca(2+) influx in cardiomyocytes is regulated by the activity of the heteromeric L-type voltage-activated CaV1.2 channel. A complex network of interactions between the different proteins forming the ion channel supports the kinetics and the activation gating of the Ca(2+) influx. Alterations in the biophysical and biochemical properties or in the biogenesis in any of these proteins can lead to serious disturbances in the cardiac rhythm. The multi-subunit nature of the channel complex is better comprehended by examining the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of the closely related CaV1.1 channel. The architectural map identifies precise interaction loci between the different subunits and paves the way for elucidating the mechanistic basis for the regulation of Ca(2+) balance in cardiac myocytes under physiological and pathological conditions.
