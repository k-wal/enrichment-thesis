28314676|t|First and second generation DESs reduce diabetes adverse effect on mortality and re-intervention in multivessel coronary disease: 9- Year analysis
28314676|a|Diabetes portends an increased risk of adverse early and late outcomes in patients undergoing PCI. In this study, we aimed to investigate if the adverse effect of diabetes mellitus (DM) on early and late PCI outcomes is reduced with drug-eluting (DES) compared to bare-metal (BMS) stents. We reviewed the Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital first PCI experience for multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD, 1998-2009). Patients were excluded if they had single-vessel CAD, emergency, no stent, prior bypass graft or myocardial infarction <24h. Diabetes - effect was derived from 9- year all-cause mortality and re-intervention risk-adjusted hazard ratios [AHR (95% confidence intervals)] for DES (N=2679; 48% three-vessel; 39% DM) and BMS (N=2651; 40% three-vessel; 33% DM) and then stratified based on stent (DES / BMS) and vessel disease (two / three). Diabetes - effect on mortality was lower for DES (AHRDM/NoDM =1.41 [1.14-1.74]) versus BMS (AHRDM/NoDM =1.71 [1.50-2.01]), but this was predominantly driven by two-vessel patients. This diabetes effect was similar for first (DES1: AHRDM/NoDM =1.43 [1.14-1.79]) and second (DES2: AHRDM/NoDM =1.53 [0.77-3.07]) generation DES. Re-intervention comparisons were similarly increased by diabetes in all sub-cohorts. Our analysis of a large real-world PCI series indicates that diabetes is associated with worse 9- year mortality irrespective of stent type, albeit this is mitigated to varying degrees with DES, particularly in DES2 and in case of 2-vessel disease. A complementary stent - effect analysis confirmed DES -to- BMS and DES2 -to- DES1 superiority in both diabetics and non-diabetics.
