28451474|t|Adjuvant Radiotherapy for Thymic Neuroendocrine Tumors: A Case Report and Review of the Literature
28451474|a|Thymic carcinoid tumors are very rare. Between two and four percent of carcinoids originate from the thymus with an estimated incidence of 1.5 to 3 per 10,000,000 persons per year. Thymic carcinoids can be associated with the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. The principal treatment is surgical resection. The potential roles of systemic and radiation treatments are a matter of debate. We describe the successful multidisciplinary treatment of a case of thymic carcinoid associated with MEN and review the literature pertaining to the use of adjuvant thoracic radiation.
