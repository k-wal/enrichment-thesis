27987144|t|RNActive® Technology: Generation and Testing of Stable and Immunogenic mRNA Vaccines
27987144|a|Developing effective mRNA vaccines poses certain challenges concerning mRNA stability and ability to induce sufficient immune stimulation and requires a specific panel of techniques for production and testing. Here, we describe the production of stabilized mRNA with enhanced immunogenicity, generated using conventional nucleotides only, by introducing changes to the mRNA sequence and by complexation with the nucleotide-binding peptide protamine (RNActive® technology). Methods described here include the synthesis, purification, and protamine complexation of mRNA vaccines as well as a comprehensive panel of in vitro and in vivo methods for evaluation of vaccine quality and immunogenicity.
