27875815|t|Wang's Forceps -Assisted Catheter Reposition and Fixation: An Easy and Reliable Rescue Method
27875815|a|Catheter migration and omental wrap are the most common causes of catheter malfunction, which usually result in catheter removal or replacement. The conventional open surgery for catheter reposition has many disadvantages. A new tunnel is needed throughout the procedure of catheter replacement causing more pain and frustration to the patients. Another drawback is that the incidence of catheter migration after conventional catheter reposition surgery is still as high as it was before the procedure. Wang's forceps, an instrument commonly used in our peritoneal dialysis center, is easy and effective in catheter insertion and fixation. Recently, we have successfully used the Wang's forceps to resolve the catheter displacement for 10 patients, including 1 patient who suffered from catheter tip migration 3 times and had undergone conventional catheter rescue by both open surgery and laparoscopy. This new technique was easy and reliable, and the original tunnel was maintained, which reduced pain and risk of infection in the patients. These advantages may grant the Wang's forceps technique favorable over the conventional surgical approach.
