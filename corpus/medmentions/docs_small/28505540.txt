28505540|a|Defining the level of protective factors in saliva of patients suffering from decompensated type 2 diabetes. 50 Patients with diagnosis of decompensated type 2 diabetes, including 32 women and 18 men at the age of 57.9±9.2 years. The control group consisted of 50 people among whom there were 38 women and 12 men whose average age was estimated at 51.2±9.9 years. It was stated the increased concentration of total protein by 60% and decreased concentration of IgA by 70%, of lysozyme by 27% and of lactoferrin by 40% in resting saliva of patients with type 2 diabetes if compared to the control group. These outcomes were really statistically meaningful. The evaluation of dependences between the analyzed protective factors and the indicator of oral cavity condition proved the positive correlation between the concentration of total protein and the number of DMFT (i.e. the rate of caries intensity). The remaining coefficients of correlation being evaluated proved to be negative and statistically meaningless. The obtained outcomes prove a high influence of proteins included in saliva on the prevalence and development of caries at patients with decompensated type 2 diabetes.
