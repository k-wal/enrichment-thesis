27432486|t|The use of neonatal extracorporeal life support in pediatric cardiac intensive care unit
27432486|a|The aim of the study is to evaluate extracorporeal life support system (ECLS) employed in neonates in pediatric cardiac intensive care unit. Twenty-five neonates that required ECLS in between November 2010 and November 2015 were evaluated. The median age was 12 days (range 3-28 days) and the median body weight was 3 kg (range 2.5-5 kg). Venoarterial ECLS was performed in all of the cases. Ascendan aorta - right atrial cannulation in 22 patients and neck cannulation in three patients were performed. The reason for ECLS was E-CPR in two patients, inability to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in seven patients, respiratory insufficiency and hypoxia in nine patients, low cardiac output (LCOS) in seven patients. Median duration of ECLS was four days (range 1-15). Hemorrhagic complications developed in 15, renal complications in 13, pulmonary complications in 12, infectious complications in 11, neurologic complications in three and mechanical complications in two of the patients. Weaning was successful in 15 of the patients. Eleven patients were successfully discharged. ECLS is an important treatment option that is performed successfully in many centers around the world to maintain life support in patients unresponsive to medical treatment. The utilization of this modality especially in newborns with congenital heart disease should be taken into consideration.
