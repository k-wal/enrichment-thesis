28060068|a|To investigate risk factors, clinical features, and treatment outcomes of recurrent Mooren ulcers in China. Medical records of 139 patients (173 eyes) with Mooren ulcers, including 37 patients (38 eyes) with recurrence, were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical features and treatment outcomes were evaluated. The risk factors for ulcer recurrence were analyzed with logistic regression; the cumulative risk of recurrence was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis. The ratio of males to females with Mooren ulcers was 1.62:1. As to age, 32 of 106 patients aged >35 years and 5 of 33 younger patients (28 males and 9 females) had recurrence. Forty-one patients had bilateral disease (7 eyes removed before their visit to our hospital were excluded) and 98 patients had unilateral disease, with recurrence in 10 and 27 patients, respectively. Thirty eyes had recurrence around the primary lesion; 27 eyes had recurrence within 12 months after treatment. Of all eyes, 97.7% were saved and 81.5% retained vision better than 0.05. The cumulative risk of first recurrence at 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months was 10.4%, 17.1%, 22.5%, 27.2%, and 28.6%, respectively. Male sex (P = 0.043) and surgical treatment (P = 0.035) were significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrence. This study provided the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with recurrent Mooren ulcers in China. The cumulative risk of first recurrence at 4 years after treatment was 28.6%. Male patients and patients with severe ulcers that required surgery had an increased risk of recurrence.
