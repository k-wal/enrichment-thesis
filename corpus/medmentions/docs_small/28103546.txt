28103546|t|Quantifying Net Synergy / Redundancy of Spontaneous Variability Regulation via Predictability and Transfer Entropy Decomposition Frameworks
28103546|a|Indexes assessing the balance between redundancy and synergy were hypothesized to be helpful in characterizing cardiovascular control from spontaneous beat-to-beat variations of heart period (HP), systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and respiration (R). Net redundancy / synergy indexes were derived according to predictability and transfer entropy decomposition strategies via a multivariate linear regression approach. Indexes were tested in two protocols inducing modifications of the cardiovascular regulation via baroreflex loading / unloading (i.e. head-down tilt at -25° and graded head-up tilt at 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75° and 90° respectively). The net redundancy / synergy of SAP and R to HP and of HP and R to SAP were estimated over stationary sequences of 256 successive values. We found that: i) regardless of the target (i.e. HP or SAP) redundancy was prevalent over synergy and this prevalence was independent of type and magnitude of the baroreflex challenge; ii) the prevalence of redundancy disappeared when decoupling inputs from output via surrogate approach; iii) net redundancy was under autonomic control given that it varied in proportion to the vagal withdrawal during graded head-up tilt; iv) conclusions held regardless of the decomposition strategy. Net redundancy indexes can monitor changes of cardiovascular control from a perspective completely different from that provided by more traditional univariate and multivariate methods. Net redundancy measures might provide a practical tool to quantify the reservoir of effective cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms sharing causal influences over a target variable.
