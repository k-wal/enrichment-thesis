28391771|t|The lived experience of behaviours of concern: A qualitative study of men with traumatic brain injury
28391771|a|Behaviours of Concern (BoC) are a debilitating consequence of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Whilst perspectives of clinicians, carers and family members on BoC have been previously explored, few qualitative studies have included individuals with TBI. The aim of this study was to explore the lived experience of BoC in individuals with TBI, their close others and clinicians. Eleven males with TBI and BoC were recruited and 25 semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted (9 individuals with TBI, 9 close others, 7 clinicians). A six-phase thematic analysis approach was utilised. Frequent and persistent BoC were reported and the key themes identified included the brain injury, control, environment, mood, identity, social relationships, and meaningful participation. Whilst the brain injury contributed to BoC in all cases, the way the other themes manifested and interacted was variable. This study enriches our understanding of factors associated with BoC. Themes emerging from this study will inform interventions designed to reduce BoC and ultimately maximise quality of life for individuals with TBI and their families.
