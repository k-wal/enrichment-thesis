27746068|t|Targeting postprandial blood sugar over fasting blood sugar: A clinic based comparative study
27746068|a|Recent studies indicate that modulation of post prandial blood sugar (PPBS) plays an important role in the long term glycemic control. Measurement of PPBS is more convenient for patients attending outpatient clinics than fasting blood sugar (FBS) as the former needs only two hours of fasting from the last meal. To assess the value of PPBS monitoring in optimization of long term glycemic control among diabetic patients attending an outpatient clinic. A total of 240 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) attending an out-patient medical clinic were randomized to either PPBS or FBS monitoring. Those who selected to PPBS - group underwent blood sugar measurement 2-h after last meal on the day of their clinic visits and those in the FBS group underwent blood sugar measurement after fasting overnight (8-10h) in the morning of their clinic visits. Treating team was asked to optimize the anti-diabetic medications based on the available PPBS or FBS results. All patients were followed up monthly for six months. Glycemic control was assessed with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at baseline and six months later. Baseline characteristics of the two arms including age, gender, and duration of T2DM were not significantly different. Mean HbA1c (SD) of FBS and PPBS arms at baseline were 7.20 (0.45), and 7.33 (0.43) and were not significantly different (P=0.115). During the study period, HbA1c dropped by 0.20 in FBS arm compared to 0.25 drop in PPBS arm (p=0.59). Incidence of hypoglycemia was similar in FBS (2.42%) and PPBS arms (2.70%). Monitoring of PPBS is a safe and effective alternative to FBS to optimize glycemic control in managing patients with T2DM attending outpatient clinics.
