28276968|t|Delivery of drugs, growth factors, genes and stem cells via intrapericardial, epicardial and intramyocardial routes for sustained local targeted therapy of myocardial disease
28276968|a|Local myocardial delivery (LMD) of therapeutic agents is a promising strategy that aims to treat various myocardial pathologies. It is designed to deliver agents directly to the myocardium and minimize their extracardiac concentrations and side effects. LMD aims to enhance outcomes of existing therapies by broadening their therapeutic window and to utilize new agents that could not be otherwise be implemented systemically. Areas covered: This article provides a historical overview of six decades LMD evolution in terms of the approaches, including intrapericardial, epicardial, and intramyocardial delivery, and the wide array of classes of agents used to treat myocardial pathologies. We examine delivery of pharmaceutical compounds, targeted gene transfection and cell implantation techniques to produce therapeutic effects locally. We outline therapeutic indications, successes and failures as well as technical approaches for LMD. Expert opinion: While LMD is more complicated than conventional oral or intravenous administration, given recent advances in interventional cardiology, it is safe and may provide better therapeutic outcomes. LMD is complex as many factors impact pharmacokinetics and biologic result. The choice between routes of LMD is largely driven not only by the myocardial pathology but also by the nature and physicochemical properties of the therapeutic agents.
