27471103|t|Readily Accessible and Predictable Naphthalene -Based Two-Photon Fluorophore with Full Visible - Color Coverage
27471103|a|Herein we report 22 acedan -derived, two-photon fluorophores with synthetic feasibility and full coverage of visible wavelength emission. The emission wavelengths were predicted by computational analysis, which enabled us to visualize multicolor images by two-photon excitation with single wavelength, and to design a turn-on, two-photon fluorescence sensor for endogenous H2 O2 in Raw 264.7 macrophage and rat brain hippocampus ex vivo.
