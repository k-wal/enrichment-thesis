27923842|t|Predicting MEK Inhibitor Response in Lung Cancer: A Proper Signature Is Required
27923842|a|The ERK signaling pathway is one of the most commonly deregulated pathways in cancer. Assays that accurately measure ERK signaling output in clinical specimens would be extremely helpfu l not only in determining the pharmacodynamic effects of drug treatment but also in selecting those patients most likely to respond to therapy.
