27876369|t|Multi-component model of intramural hematoma
27876369|a|A novel multi-component model is introduced for studying interaction between blood flow and deforming aortic wall with intramural hematoma (IMH). The aortic wall is simulated by a composite structure submodel representing material properties of the three main wall layers. The IMH is described by a poroelasticity submodel which takes into account both the pressure inside hematoma and its deformation. The submodel of the hematoma is fully coupled with the aortic submodel as well as with the submodel of the pulsatile blood flow. Model simulations are used to investigate the relation between the peak wall stress, hematoma thickness and permeability in patients of different age. The results indicate that an increase in hematoma thickness leads to larger wall stress, which is in agreement with clinical data. Further simulations demonstrate that a hematoma with smaller permeability results in larger wall stress, suggesting that blood coagulation in hematoma might increase its mechanical stability. This is in agreement with previous experimental observations of coagulation having a beneficial effect on the condition of a patient with the IMH.
