28332776|a|The aim of the study is to investigate the association of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms with the susceptibility of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in Chinese children without known family history of HLH. Forty children with HLH and 160 age - and gender -matched healthy controls from Xuzhou Children's Hospital were enrolled in the study. Serum IFN-γ and IL-10 levels were measured by enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay. Polymorphisms of the IFN-γ gene at position +874 and +2109, and IL-10 at position -1082 were analyzed by allele - specific PCR. Median serum concentrations of IFN -γ and IL-10 were significantly higher in children with HLH compared to healthy controls. The frequencies of IFN-γ +874 T/A and T/T genotypes, as well as T allele, were significantly higher in the HLH group compared with those in the control group. The frequencies of IL-10 -1082 G/A genotype and G allele were significantly increased in HLH patients compared with healthy controls. No significant difference was found in the distribution of IFN-γ +2109 G/A genotypes between children with HLH and controls. This study presents preliminary evidence for the association between IFN +874 T/A, T/T, IL-10 -1082 A/G genotypes, and HLH susceptibility in Chinese children with HLH.
