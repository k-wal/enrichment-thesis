27770391|t|The effectiveness of disc synoptoscope on patients with abnormal binocular vision: a prospective cohort study
27770391|a|We performed a prospective cohort study to evaluate the effectiveness of disc synoptoscope on binocularity in patients with abnormal binocular vision. 39 eligible subjects were recruited for visual therapy with disc synoptoscope in treatment group and 38 were just observed as control. Simultaneous perception in treatment group was better than controls at 6- month visit (p < 0.05). Fusional amplitude improved in treatment group but decreased in control group at 3- and 6- months visits (p < 0.001). Near and distance stereopsis in treatment group were better than controls at 3- and 6- months (p < 0.05). The improvements of monocular and binocular acuity in treatment group were better than controls at 3- and 6- months (p < 0.05). Postoperative recurrence rate in treatment group was lower than controls (p < 0.05). Visual therapy with disc synoptoscope is effective in improving short-term binocular vision for the patients with abnormal binocular vision; disc synoptoscope could serve as an effective home -based visual therapy instrument.
