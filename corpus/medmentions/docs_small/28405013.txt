28405013|t|A missense variant, rs373863828-A (p.Arg457Gln), of CREBRF and body mass index in Oceanic populations
28405013|a|It has been suggested that a 'thrifty' genotype hypothesis can account for high prevalence of obesity in the island populations of Oceania. A recent genome-wide association study revealed that a missense variant, rs373863828-A (p.Arg457Gln), of the CREBRF gene (encoding CREB3 regulatory factor) was associated with an excessive increase in body mass index (BMI) in Samoans. In the present study, the association of rs373863828-A with an increase in BMI was examined in four Austronesian (AN)- speaking populations in Oceania. We found that rs373863828-A was frequently observed (frequency of 0.15) in Tongans (Polynesians), and was strongly associated with higher BMI (P=6.1 Ã— 10(-4)). A single copy of the rs373863828-A allele increased BMI by 3.09 kg m(-2) after adjustment of age and sex. No significant association was detected in the other three AN - speaking populations (Melanesians and Micronesians) living in Solomon Islands. This was probably due to the low allele frequency (0.02-0.06) of rs373863828-A as well as small sample size. The rs373863828-A allele was not found in both AN - speaking and non- AN - speaking Melanesians living in Papua New Guinea. Our results suggest that rs373863828-A of CREBRF, a promising thrifty variant, arose in recent ancestors of AN - speaking Polynesians .Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 13 April 2017; doi:10.1038/jhg.2017.44.
