27935120|a|This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of female high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection in Shaanxi province of China. A total of 14 111 women were enrolled for HPV genotyping test, and a cytology, and/or cervix biopsy were performed in partial women. Of these women, the HPV infection rate was 30.21%, and 26.73% were caused by HR-HPV. The most common HR-HPV genotypes were HPV-16, HPV-58, HPV-52, HPV-18, and HPV-31. The prevalence of HR-HPV among women older than 50 years was significantly higher than the other groups (P < 0.05). The main carcinogenic genotypes were HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-58, HPV-52, and HPV-31. HPV-16 and HPV-18 combined caused 80.79% of cervical cancer cases. The infection with multiple HR-HPVs was not a risk factor for cervical lesions. In conclusion, HPV infection was common among women in Shaanxi province. Women older than 50 years were a high-risk group for HR-HPV infection and cervical cancer. HPV-16 and HPV-18 were the main carcinogenic genotypes in this region.
