27364111|t|Physicians' knowledge on the work-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
27364111|a|Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be induced by the work environment conditions. According to the estimates, 10-20% of all COPD cases are associated with occupational exposure to dusts and irritant gases. However, in 2014, only 11 cases of work-related COPD were recognized in Poland. The aim of the study was to analyze the reasons for the low incidence of work-related COPD in the context of pulmonologists ' knowledge about occupational risk factors and procedures on reporting suspected occupational diseases. A survey included 94 pulmonologists randomly selected out of 225 specialists registered at the Local Physicians Chamber in Łódź. The study was performed anonymously with the use of original questionnaire. More than a half of the surveyed pulmonologists identified environmental risk factors for COPD correctly, while only 23.4% properly identified the main occupational risk factors as the cause of COPD. Only 58.5% of the pulmonologists always asked their patients suffering from COPD about their job / profession and 60.6% of them did not have any knowledge about procedures on reporting suspected occupational diseases. The physicians rarely ask patients suffering from COPD about their job / profession and the relationship between their ailments and occupational exposure. What is more, they do not know legal regulations on proper referral of a patient with a suspected case of occupational disease. The results of the study clearly indicate that there is an urgent need for increasing pulmonologists ' knowledge on work-related COPD. Med Pr 2016;67(3):375-384.
