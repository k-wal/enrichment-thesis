28527621|a|Physical activity has been shown to significantly improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and survivorship in a variety of patients with cancer. However, little is known about the physical activity patterns of bladder cancer survivors and how these are related to HRQOL in the United States. Our objective was to describe self-reported physical activity patterns and HRQOL and examine the association between these measures in a large cohort of bladder cancer survivors. In this cross-sectional study, long-term bladder cancer survivors identified through an institutional database were mailed a survey that included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bladder Cancer (FACT-BL) and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Associations between HRQOL, as assessed by the FACT-BL, and physical activity, as assessed by the IPAQ, were examined by stratified analyses of HRQOL by different levels of physical activity, proportional odds ordinal logistic regression models, and local polynomial regression models. A total of 472 subjects (49% response rate) completed the survey. The mean age was 74 years; 81% were male and 87% were white. The median total weekly physical activity was 2,794 MET-min. Subjects reporting " high " physical activity had a median FACT-BL score of 129 compared with 119 among those reporting " low " physical activity, a statistically and clinically significant difference. Similarly, subjects reporting " high " physical activity had a 2.2-fold increased odds of reporting higher global HRQOL compared with subjects reporting " low " physical activity. This large cohort of bladder cancer survivors reported high levels of physical activity. Physical activity was positively associated with HRQOL. Further studies investigating the causal relationship between physical activity and HRQOL in the posttreatment setting in bladder cancer survivors are warranted.
