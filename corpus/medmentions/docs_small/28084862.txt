28084862|t|Visual outcome, endocrine function and tumor control after fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy of craniopharyngiomas in adults: findings in a prospective cohort
28084862|a|The purpose of this study was to examine visual outcome, endocrine function and tumor control in a prospective cohort of craniopharyngioma patients, treated with fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT). Sixteen adult patients with craniopharyngiomas were eligible for analysis. They were treated with linear accelerator-based FSRT during 1999-2015. In all cases, diagnosis was confirmed by histological analysis. The prescription dose to the tumor was 54 Gy (median, range 48-54) in 1.8 or 2.0 Gy per fraction, and the maximum radiation dose to the optic nerves and chiasm was 54.2 Gy (median, range 48.6-60.0) for the cohort. Serial ophthalmological and endocrine evaluations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed at regular intervals. Median follow-up was 3.3 years (range 1.1-14.1), 3.7 years (range 0.8-15.2), and 3.6 years (range 0.7-13.1) for visual outcome, endocrine function, and tumor control, respectively. Visual acuity impairment was present in 10 patients (62.5%) and visual field defects were present in 12 patients (75%) before FSRT. One patient developed radiation-induced optic neuropathy at seven years after FSRT. Thirteen of 16 patients (81.3%) had pituitary deficiency before FSRT, and did not develop further pituitary deficiency after FSRT. Mean tumor volume pre- FSRT was 2.72 cm(3) (range 0.20-9.90) and post- FSRT 1.2 cm(3) (range 0.00-13.10). Tumor control rate was 81.3% at two, five, and 10 years after FSRT. FSRT was relatively safe in this prospective cohort of craniopharyngiomas, with only one case of radiation-induced optic neuropathy and no case of new endocrinopathy. Tumor control rate was acceptable.
