28232924|a|Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is a primary lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia characterized by a progressive band-like recession of the frontotemporal hairline and frequent loss of the eyebrows. It predominantly affects postmenopausal women. Coexistence of FFA and vitiligo is rarely reported in the literature. We retrospectively studied 20 cases diagnosed with FFA in a 14- month period in our Department. Among them, there were 2 cases, a 72-year-old woman and a 48-year-old man, who developed FFA on preexisting vitiligo of the forehead. Anatomical colocalization of the two dermatoses supports the notion that a causal link may exist and their association may not be coincidental. We suggest that interrelated immunologic events and pathologic processes may underlie both these skin conditions.
