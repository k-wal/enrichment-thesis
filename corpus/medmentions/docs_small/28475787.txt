28475787|t|Zero Transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: Lessons Learned From Thailand
28475787|a|New emerging pathogens can quickly become a global health threat in this era. A number of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks have been linked to healthcare facilities. The healthcare -associated transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS - CoV) has been attributed to overcrowding, delayed diagnosis, and the breakdown of infection control systems. Strict infection control precautions and a well-prepared hospital system may have contributed to no nosocomial transmission occurring during the treatment of MERS - CoV infections imported to Thailand. The recent outbreaks of MERS and previous emerging infections provide valuable lessons to be learned. Continuous vigilance and strengthening of infection control systems will shape the capacity to prevent and control MERS - CoV or new emerging disease transmission.
