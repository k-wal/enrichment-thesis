28360773|t|Spontaneous Ejaculations Associated with Aripiprazole
28360773|a|Sexual side effects are common with antipsychotic use. Spontaneous ejaculations without sexual arousal have been previously described with several typical and atypical antipsychotics. We report the case of a man who had spontaneous ejaculations after stopping risperidone and starting 30 mg/day aripiprazole. Spontaneous ejaculations ceased 3 days after decreasing the aripiprazole dose to 15 mg/day. He denied sexual fantasies or increased sexual desire during the period in which he had spontaneous ejaculations. The partial agonistic effect of aripiprazole on D2 receptors may have augmented the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, which was suppressed by risperidone, causing spontaneous ejaculations in this patient. Serotoninergic effects of aripiprazole should also be considered. This unusual side effect should be questioned, particularly in patients who recieve aripiprazole after D2-blocking antipsychotics; otherwise, this side effect may cause embarrassement and noncompliance.
