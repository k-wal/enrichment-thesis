27942614|a|Protein -stabilized gold nanoclusters (protein - Au NCs) have been an attractive frontier of nanoparticle research. Due to their unique fluorescence properties, high stability, environmentally friendly synthetic routes and nontoxicity, protein - Au NCs could find applications in highly sensitive and selective detection of metal ions, inorganic ions and biomolecules in food, soil, water and biological samples. The past few years have witnessed the development of many successful strategies for the preparation of numerous protein - Au NC -based sensing systems. In this review, we focus on a number of sensing systems based on protein - Au NCs for the detection of various analytes of interest with a special emphasis on their corresponding sensing mechanisms.
