28168637|a|This study aims to illustrate the results of percutaneous forefoot surgery (PFS) for correction of hallux valgus. A prospective study of 108 patients, with hallux valgus deformity, who underwent PFS was conducted. The minimum clinical and radiological follow-up was two years (mean 57.3 months, range 22-112). Preoperative mean visual analog scale was 6.3 ± 1.5 points, and AOFAS scores were 50.6 ± 11 points. At the last follow-up, both scores improved to 1.9 ± 2.4 points and 85.9 ± 1.83 points, respectively. Mean hallux valgus angle changed from 34.3° ± 9.3° preoperatively to 22.5° ± 11.1° at follow-up. At follow-up, 76.5% of the subjects were satisfied or very satisfied. Recurrence of medial 1st MT head pain happened in 22 cases (16.7%). PFS, in our study, does not improve the radiological and patient satisfaction rate results compared with conventional procedures. The main advantage is a low postoperative pain level, but with an insufficient HVA correction. II, prospective study.
