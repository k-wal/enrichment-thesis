27514764|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the possible renoprotective effect of Plantago major extract against cisplatin -induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Rats were divided into 6 groups. The first group was the control, group 2 was treated with cisplatin (7 mg/kg, single dose), and groups 3 to 6 received cisplatin with vitamin E (100 mg/kg) and Plantago major extract at doses of 300 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg, and 1200 mg/kg, for 20 days. On day12, serum concentration of urea, creatinine, and potassium significantly increased and sodium concentration significantly decreased in the cisplatin group compared with the control rats. However, serum creatinine, urea, and potassium concentrations were significantly lower in all of the Plantago major groups compared to the cisplatin group. Also, there was a significant elevation in serum sodium concentration in the Plantago major 600 mg/kg group compared to the cisplatin group on day12. Injection of cisplatin caused a significant elevation in malondialdehyde concentration but a significant decrease in catalase activity and total thiol content compared to the control group. Plantago major extract at 1200 mg/kg significantly improved malondialdehyde concentration and total thiol content compared to the cisplatin group. Catalase activity with Plantago major significantly increased at all doses compared to the cisplatin group. The current study suggests that Plantago major extract and vitamin E are able to improve kidney function as well as oxidative stress in cisplatin -induced renal toxicity in the rat.
