28167269|t|Neighborhoods and racial/ethnic differences in ideal cardiovascular health (the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis)
28167269|a|Using data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis baseline sample from 2000 to 2002 (N=5263; mean age =62) we examined cross-sectional racial/ethnic differences in ideal CVH, defined by the American Heart Association 2020 Impact Goals as a summary measure of ideal levels of blood pressure, fasting glucose, cholesterol, body mass index, diet, physical activity, and smoking. Using three different analytical approaches, we examined differences before and after adjustment for neighborhood socioeconomic, physical, and social environments. Significant racial/ethnic differences were present for all indicators of ideal CVH (excluding physical activity). Additional adjustments for neighborhood factors produced modest reductions in racial/ethnic differences. Future research is necessary to better understand the impact of neighborhood context on health disparities using longitudinal study designs.
