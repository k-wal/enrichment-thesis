27932645|t|Complete Genome Sequences of the Endophytic Streptomyces Strains EN16, EN23, and EN27, Isolated from Wheat Plants
27932645|a|The complete genome sequences of three endophytic Streptomyces species were compared. Strains EN16, EN23, and EN27 were isolated from surface- sterilized roots of wheat plants from South Australia. In field trials, these strains are effective in suppressing fungal root diseases of wheat when added as spore coatings to wheat seed.
