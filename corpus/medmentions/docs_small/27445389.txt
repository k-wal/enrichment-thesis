27445389|t|Complete Genome Sequence Analysis of a Naturally Reassorted Infectious Bursal Disease Virus from India
27445389|a|The novel infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) isolate BGE14/ABT1/MVC/India is a very virulent IBDV that was isolated from broiler flocks in southern parts of India during 2014. Here, we report, for the first time in India, the complete genome sequence of BGE14/ABT1/MVC/India, a reassortment strain with segments A and B derived from a very virulent IBDV strain and an attenuated IBDV, respectively. The findings from this study provide additional insight into the genetic exchange between attenuated and very virulent strains of IBDV circulating in the field.
