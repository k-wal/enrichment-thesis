28002035|t|The Effect of Omega-3 Supplement on Serum Lipid Profile in Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis: A Randomized Clinical Trial
28002035|a|Some recent suggestions could show omega-3 condition deficiency following prolonged hemodialysis; however, these claims and speculations have not been well demonstrated with sufficient evidences. Hence, we attempted to assess the beneficial effects of omega-3 on lipid profile in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis. One hundred and seventeen ESRD patients who were on maintenance dialysis in Rasoul-e-Akram and Madaen Hospitals were enrolled in this randomized clinical trial. These patients were divided into two groups randomly using block randomization method (57 patients as the case group receiving omega-3 for 12 weeks and 60 as the control group). Blood sample was taken from all patients for measurement of lipid profile, serum hemoglobin, and C-reactive protein at baseline as well as after the completion of interventions (after 12 weeks). The average change in the value of HDL-C was significantly more in the patients who received omega-3 than in the control group (MD, -7 mg/dL; 95% CI, -11 to 0 p = 0.000). Also, the reduction in serum creatinine level was more in the omega-3 group than in the control group (MD, 0.7 mg/dL; 95% CI, -0.4 to 2.1 p = 0.023). The change in other indices including serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and serum hemoglobin levels was not different between the two groups. The multivariable linear regression analysis showed no difference in serum HDL level between the two groups adjusted for sex, age, and time of dialysis, while the level of serum HDL-C could be adversely predicted by duration time. Similar regression model showed a between- group difference in serum creatinine in the presence of potential confounders. The change in serum HDL level following use of omega-3 supplement is influenced by time of dialysis, not by drug effect. However, consumption of omega-3 can significantly reduce serum creatinine.
