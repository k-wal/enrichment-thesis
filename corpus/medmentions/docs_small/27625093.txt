27625093|t|Acute and Chronic Changes and Predictive Value of Tpeak-Tend for Ventricular Arrhythmia Risk in Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Patients
27625093|a|Prolongation of the Tpeak-Tend (TpTe) interval as a measurement of transmural dispersion of repolarization (TDR) is an independent risk factor for chronic heart failure mortality. However, the cardiac resynchronization therapy's (CRT) effect on TDR is controversial. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate CRTs acute and chronic effects on repolarization dispersion. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the relationship between TpTe changes and ventricular arrhythmia. The study group consisted of 101 patients treated with CRT-defibrillator (CRT-D). According to whether TpTe was shortened, patients were grouped at immediate and 1-year follow-up after CRT, respectively. The echocardiogram index and ventricular arrhythmia were observed and compared in these subgroups. For all patients, TpTe slightly increased immediately after CRT-D implantation, and then decreased at the 1-year follow-up (from 107 ± 23 to 110 ± 21 ms within 24 h, to 94 ± 24 ms at 1-year follow-up, F = 19.366,P< 0.001). No significant difference in the left ventricular reverse remodeling and ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation (VT / VF) episodes between the TpTe immediately shortened and TpTe immediately nonshortened groups. However, patients in the TpTe at 1-year shorten had a higher rate of the left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling (65% vs. 44%, χ2 = 4.495, P = 0.038) and less VT / VF episodes (log-rank test, χ2 = 10.207, P = 0.001) compared with TpTe 1-year nonshortened group. TpTe immediately after CRT-D independently predicted VT / VF episodes at 1-year follow-up (hazard ratio [HR], 1.030; P = 0.001). Patients with TpTe shortened at 1-year after CRT had a higher rate of LV reverse remodeling and less VT / VF episodes. The acute changes of TpTe after CRT have minimal value on mechanical reverse remodeling and ventricular arrhythmia.
