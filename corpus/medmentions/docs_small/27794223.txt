27794223|t|Semi-preparative HPLC separation followed by HPLC/UV and tandem mass spectrometric analysis of phorbol esters in Jatropha seed
27794223|a|Phorbol esters (PEs) are well known as the main toxic compounds in Jatropha curcas Linnaeus (JCL), the seed oil of which has been considered as a major feedstock for the production of biodiesel. In the present study, we investigated a series of PEs extracted from JCL seed kernels with methanol (MeOH), and identified more than seven components contained in the PEs. The isolation of main five components of a series of PEs was revised using a semi-preparative reversed phase HPLC analysis of ODS-3 column. The five peaks of components were successfully isolated, and peaks of J2, J3, J5, and J7 were assigned to be Jatropha factors C1, C2, C3, and C4/5, but J6 was a mixture of Jatropha factor C6 and its isomer based on the data of UV and LC-MS / MS, and J2 was identified using (1)H NMR analysis. By characterization using LC-MS / MS analysis, all components of a series of PEs were elucidated to be the 12-deoxy-16-hydroxyphorbol esters composed of isomeric form of dicarboxylic groups with same m/z value of 380.
