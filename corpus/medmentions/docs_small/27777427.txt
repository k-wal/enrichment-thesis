27777427|a|In a longitudinal study, we examined the link between changes in physical activity and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients on chronic hemodialysis. Seventy-one patients (43 males, 28 females; aged 70.9Â±10.6 years) on chronic hemodialysis in September 2013 were enrolled. The data of the 43 patients whose complete measurements were taken again in September 2014 were used for the longitudinal analysis. Clinical parameters including age, height, dry weight, duration of hemodialysis, blood pressure (BP), blood triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels, physical activity, and HRQOL were evaluated. Physical activity was measured by a tri-accelerometer, and HRQOL was evaluated by the EuroQol questionnaire (EQ-5D). In the first cross-sectional analysis, EQ-5D scores were significantly correlated with daily step counts (steps per day) on all days and non-hemodialysis days. In the second longitudinal analysis, in the women, changes in EQ-5D scores were positively correlated with changes in daily step counts on all days. In all patients, changes in EQ-5D were weakly and negatively correlated with changes in physical activity (1-3 METs: min per day) on hemodialysis days. Promoting daily physical activity may improve the HRQOL in patients on chronic hemodialysis, especially in women.
