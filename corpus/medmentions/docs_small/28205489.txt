28205489|a|We present a case of quadrilateral space syndrome (QSS) in a patient with left arm pain. The patient sustained a trauma to his left arm, and QSS was successfully diagnosed by physical examination, magnetic resonance image, electromyographic evaluation, and nerve conduction studies. Surgery was performed to decompress the axillary nerve and the patient recovered fully with minimal residual symptoms.
