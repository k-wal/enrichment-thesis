27754198|t|JS ISH-ECCR-3 A NOVEL ALGORITHM FOR THE CASE DETECTION OF THE MOST COMMON FORM OF ENDOCRINE HYPERTENSION
27754198|a|Primary aldosteronism (PA) involves more than 11% of patients referred to specialized hypertension centers and, therefore, is much more common than commonly held. Moreover, it causes a damage to the heart, blood vessels and kidneys, which translates into a high rate of cardiovascular events, in excess to the degree of blood pressure raise. Along with the notion that a timely diagnosis entails a fundamental step for the choice of an appropriate therapy, which can correct the arterial hypertension and the hypokalemia, this justifies efforts to search for PA in the majority of the patients with hypertension. Unfortunately, because of the lack of the classical signs, as spontaneous or drug-induced hypokalemia and related symptoms, PA deceives diagnosis in the majority of the cases .The identification of a curable form of primary aldosteronism can be beneficial particularly in some subgroups of patients, namely those with drug - resistant hypertension, who are at high risk of primary aldosteronism. An aggressive diagnostic approach is necessary in these patients, who can benefit most from an accurate diagnosis. Knowledge of the sodium intake and drug effects on the aldosterone-renin ratio is a key element for the diagnosis in these challenging cases .With the latest work-up endorsed by the Endocrine Society Guidelines and supported by the results of the AQUARR Study, the diagnostic algorithm for PA can be substantially simplified. This means skipping the so-called confirmatory tests in most cases and thus rendering the screening of PA feasible and affordable. Hence, most centers can nowadays exploit use of a cost - effective strategy to screen for patients with primary aldosteronism. At variance, the identification of primary aldosteronism subtypes, which involves adrenal vein sampling (AVS), should only be undertaken at tertiary referral centers that have experience in performing and interpreting this minimally invasive test .Overall, long-term cure biochemical cure can be consistently achieved when adrenalectomy is based on AVS - based identification of lateralized aldosterone excess. Moreover, long-term cure of hypertension, defined as no need for antihypertensive drug treatment, can be achieved in about 45% of the cases, with an additional 40% showing a marked improvement in blood pressure control. Lack of blood pressure normalization can be explained by misdiagnosis and/or concomitant essential hypertension.
