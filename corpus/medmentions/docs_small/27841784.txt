27841784|a|To compare the efficacy, safety, and microstructural corneal changes during 2 years after conventional corneal collagen cross-linking (C - CXL) and transepithelial corneal CXL by iontophoresis (I - CXL) for keratoconus. Eighty eyes of 80 patients with progressive keratoconus were treated by C - CXL (n = 40) or I - CXL (n = 40). Patients were investigated before surgery and 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment. We measured central corneal thickness and maximal simulated keratometry values (Kmax) and performed specular microscopy and in vivo confocal microscopy at each time point. The demarcation line was assessed 1 month after treatment. Kmax remained stable after I - CXL during the entire study period (P = 0.56), whereas the average keratometry increased by 0.2 diopter (50.9 ± 5.6-51.1 ± 5.2). Kmax significantly decreased 1 (P = 0.02) to 2 years (P < 0.01) after C - CXL, with an average decrease of 1.1 diopters (49.9 ± 4.5-48.8 ± 4.2). The failure rate of I - CXL was 20% and that of C - CXL 7.5%. The demarcation line was superficially visible in 35% of cases after I - CXL compared with 95% of cases after C - CXL. Endothelial cell density and central corneal thickness remained stable during the entire study period. The change in Kmax 2 years after C - CXL and I - CXL and the preoperative Kmax were negatively correlated (r = 0.14, P = 0.013, and r = 0.17, P = 0.007, respectively). I - CXL halted progression of keratoconus less efficiently than did C - CXL after 2 years of follow-up. Longer prospective studies are still needed to ensure I - CXL efficacy.
