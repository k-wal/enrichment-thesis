28443672|a|Laboratory assays that identify recent HIV infections are important for assessing impacts of interventions aimed at reducing HIV incidence. Kinetics of HIV humoral responses can vary with inherent assay properties, and between HIV subtypes, populations and physiological states. They are important in determining mean duration of recent infection (MDRI) for antibody-based assays for detecting recent HIV infections. We determined MDRIs for BED-CEIA, LAg and BRAI assays for 101 seroconverting postpartum women, recruited in Harare in 1997- 2000 during the Zimbabwe Vitamin A for Mothers and Babies (ZVITAMBO) Trial, comparing them against published MDRIs estimated from seroconverting cases in the general population. We also compared MDRIs for women who seroconverted either during the first nine months, or at later stages, postpartum. At cut-offs (C) of 0.8 for BED, 1.5 for LAg and 40% for BRAI, estimated MDRIs for postpartum mothers, were 192, 104 and 144 days, 33%, 32-41% and 52% lower than published estimates of 287, 152-177 and 298 days, respectively, for clade C samples from general populations. Point estimates of MDRI values were 7 - 19% shorter for women who seroconverted in the first 9- months postpartum, compared with those seroconverting later. MDRI values for three HIV incidence biomarkers are longer in the general population than among postpartum women, particularly those who recently gave birth, consistent with heightened immunologic activation soon after birth. Our results provide a caution that MDRI may vary significantly between subjects in different physiological states.
