28416855|a|This study aimed to ferment the chicken eggshell membrane (ESM) using the lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus plantarum for preparation of functional and bioactive protein hydrolysates. Cultivation at an initial pH of 8.0 for 36 h resulted in maximum protein concentration (177.3 mg/g) and degree of hydrolysis (25.1%) of the hydrolysates. Fermentation resulted in the production of hydrolysates that demonstrated excellent solubility (90.7%), good foaming capacity (36.7%) and emulsification activity (94.6 m(2)/g). Additionally, these protein hydrolysates exhibited remarkable bioactive properties for instance reducing power (2.53), protection from DPPH radical (70.5%) and angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibition (49.3%). The fermented protein hydrolysates were also found effective against various foodborne pathogens. The protein hydrolysates obtained by fermentation of ESM can be potentially incorporated in functional foods and nutraceuticals resulting in valorization of the ESM waste.
