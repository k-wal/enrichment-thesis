28228242|a|To investigate the effect of vitamin D deficiency on the laryngopharyngeal tract. Prospective cohort study. Tertiary care center. A total of 38 human subjects were prospectively recruited, equally divided into two groups. The Vitamin D deficiency group defined as 25-OH<25ng/dl and the control subjects with normal vitamin D level defined as 25-OH>25ng/dl. The presence and severity of vocal tract symptoms was assessed using the Vocal Tract Discomfort score. There was no significant difference in vocal tract discomfort score for frequency and severity between patients with Vitamin D deficiency and patients with no vitamin D deficiency (p value 0.272). However there was a significant difference in the mean frequency of burning, aching, soreness and lump sensation (p value<0.05) in patients with vitamin D deficiency compared to those with no vitamin D deficiency. There was also a significant difference in the means of vocal tract severity symptoms, namely for burning and aching between patients with vitamin D deficiency compared to patients with no vitamin D deficiency (p value<0.05). Subjects with vitamin D deficiency do not have a higher vocal tract discomfort score than subjects with no vitamin D deficiency. However the frequency and severity of certain vocal tract discomfort symptoms was higher and can be based hypothetically on the similarity in structure between the laryngopharyngeal complex and the musculoskeletal system.
