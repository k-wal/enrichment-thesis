27709987|t|PDTRT special section: Current trends in borderline personality disorder research
27709987|a|One of the enjoyable benefits of being an editor of a journal is the ability to develop special sections. It is evident simply from a perusal of a typical issue of Personality Disorders: Theory, Research, and Treatment (PDTRT) that a common focus of research is borderline personality disorder (BPD). BPD is among, if not the, most heavily researched personality disorder. It is only natural to have the first special section within my tenure as editor concern this personality disorder. Provided within this special section are review papers of current trends in BPD research by young (at least compared to me), leading, and innovative BPD researchers. (PsycINFO Database Record
