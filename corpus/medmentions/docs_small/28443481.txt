28443481|t|Impact of Abnormal DNA Methylation of Imprinted Loci on Human Spontaneous Abortion
28443481|a|Currently, there is a growing concern regarding the safety of assisted reproductive technology (ART) due to increased risk of spontaneous abortion (SA) and imprinting disorders in ART - conceived offspring. Early investigations suggested that aberrant genetic imprinting may be related to pregnancy loss; however, few studies have used human tissue specimens. Here the DNA methylation patterns of 3 imprinted genes, including maternally inherited GRB10 and the paternally inherited IGF2 and PEG3 genes, were evaluated in human chorionic villus samples by pyrosequencing and bisulfite sequencing polymerase chain reaction. The samples were divided into 4 groups: (1) SA of natural conception (NC; n = 84), (2) induced abortion of NC (n = 94), (3) SA after ART (n = 73), and (4) fetal reduction after ART (n = 86). The methylation levels and the percentages of abnormal methylation of the IGF2, GRB10, and PEG3 genes between the ART group and the NC group showed no significant difference. Both IGF2 and GRB10 genes showed higher methylation levels in the SA group compared to the non-SA group. Additionally, determining the single-nucleotide polymorphisms of 4 loci, including IGF2 rs3741205, rs3741206, rs3741211, and GRB10 rs2237457, showed that the TC+CC genotype of IGF2 rs3741211 had a 1.91-fold increased risk of SA after ART. However, there was no association between the mutant genotype of IGF2 rs3741211 and the methylation levels of IGF2 and H19, and ART might not affect the distribution of the abovementioned genotypes. It provides support for the opinion that genetic imprinting defects may be associated with SA, which might not be due to ART treatments.
