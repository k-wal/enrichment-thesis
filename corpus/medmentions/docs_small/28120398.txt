28120398|a|The evidence for a prospective association of vitamin D deficiency with the occurrence of late-life depression is limited. We aimed to study the long-term association between vitamin D serum levels and depression in a large population-based study of older adults. We included 3251 participants from the Rotterdam Study, aged 55 and older with 32 400 person-years follow-up for depression. Baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) serum levels were analyzed continuously and categorically. Repeated depressive symptoms ' questionnaire assessments were used to assess the change of depressive symptoms. Semistructured psychiatric interviews, and GP records were used to assess incident major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. Low serum vitamin D levels were cross-sectionally associated with more depressive symptoms. However, low 25(OH)D serum levels were not prospectively associated with change of depressive symptoms (unstandardized beta = 0.02, 95% CI = -0.23; 0.26) or incident MDD (hazard ratio = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.86; 1.05). We observed a cross-sectional but no prospective association between serum vitamin D levels and depression. A cross-sectional association in the absence of the longitudinal association can mostly be attributed to reverse causality or residual confounding. Probably, vitamin D deficiency is not an independent risk factor for depression but co-occurs with late-life depression.
