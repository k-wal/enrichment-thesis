27793676|a|The goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of hypothyroidism induced by MMI, during gestation (G) or gestation plus lactation (GL) on testis and its relation with leptin in rats. Six to eight pups were killed at 90 days of age. For statistical analysis One-way ANOVA followed by the Holm-Sìdak post hoc test was used. Hypothyroidism resulted in a significant reduction in LH, FSH and testosterone and an increase in leptin serum levels (p < 0.04). There was a significant decrease in StAR, AR, FSHR, LHR, pSTAT3 and SOCS3 (p < 0.04) protein expression and in the fertility parameters (p < 0.04). We can conclude that hypothyroidism is associated with reduction of steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis leading to a low fertility potential in these animals. This outcome could be a consequence of low pituitary stimulus and testicular response and probably are not related with leptin hormone since its signaling pathway is down-regulated in the testis.
