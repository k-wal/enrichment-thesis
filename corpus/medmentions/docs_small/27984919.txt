27984919|a|The integration between radiotherapy and drugs, from chemotherapy to recently available target therapies, continues to have a relevant role in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Aim of the present review is to evaluate the promising and emerging application of the best interaction between new drugs and new modalities of radiotherapy. Areas covered: We searched Medline, Google Scholar, PubMed, ProQuest Dissertation, and Theses databases for reports published in English. A study was included when it reported on cancer-related radiotherapy and included patients with NSCLC treated with chemo and/or target therapies. Review articles were excluded from the analysis. Expert commentary: Chemo-radiotherapy still represents the standard of choice in locally advanced NSCLC, while to date the addition of target therapies to chemo-radiotherapy did not demonstrate any robust advantage in this stage of disease. Considering the absence of randomized controlled trials, the role of target therapies in early stage adjuvant NSCLC is not yet recommended in clinical practice. On the contrary, in the setting of oligometastatic and oligoprogressive disease, new molecules demonstrated to be safe and effective, opening to a promising and emerging application of the best interaction between new drugs and new modalities of radiotherapy.
