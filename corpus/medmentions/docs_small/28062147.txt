28062147|a|Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is effective therapy for significant atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. Despite medical and technological advances in PCI, periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) remains a common complication. The frequency and factors associated with PMI have been well investigated in the developed world, yet there is a paucity of data from the developing world, especially Sub-Saharan Africa. We prospectively enrolled 153 adult patients undergoing PCI at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital from the 1st of February 2014 to 31st October 2014. Periprocedural Creatinine Kinase-MB and hs-Troponin I were routinely measured before PCI and at 16-24h post-procedure. The third universal definition of myocardial infarction was used to define a PMI event. 152 participants met the inclusion criteria and were analysed for PMI. 70.4% participants were male. The mean age was 58.8 (SD 10.9) years old. Sixteen (10.5%) participants fulfilled the criteria for PMI. Side branch pinching with preserved TIMI III flow was noted in 62.5% of PMI cases. Duration of procedure (P=0.007), right coronary artery intervention (p=0.042) and total stent length (p=0.045) were independently associated with PMI. PMI occurred in 10.5% of cases undergoing PCI. This is consistent with the prevalence of PMI internationally. Larger multicentre studies are required in our demographic region to further define relevant predictors and outcomes associated with PMI.
