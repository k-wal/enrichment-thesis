27659794|t|Carbon nanotube -based self-adhesive polymer electrodes for wireless long-term recording of electrocardiogram signals
27659794|a|In this study, the concept of polymer electrodes integrated with a wireless electrocardiogram (ECG) system was described. Polymer electrodes for long-term ECG measurements were fabricated by loading high content of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in polydimethylsiloxane. Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) were added to increase the flexibility of the polymer and the conductivity of the electrode. An ECG electrode patch was fabricated by integrating the electrodes with an adhesive polydimethylsiloxane (aPDMS) layer. Holes in the electrode filled with aPDMS can enable robust contact between the electrode and skin, reducing motion artifacts. A wireless ECG measurement system was developed and adapted to the polymer electrodes. The polymer electrodes combined with the measurement system were successfully applied in wireless, long-term recording of ECG signals. An eleven- day continuous test showed that the ECG signal did not degrade over time. The results of attach/detach tests demonstrated that the ECG signal was affected by motion artifacts after six attach/detach cycles. The electrodes produced are flexible and exhibit good ECG performance, and therefore can be used in wearable medical monitoring systems. The approach proposed in this study holds significant promise for commercial application in medical fields.
