28221291|a|To characterize ophthalmic manifestations and periocular injuries of pediatric facial dog bites. A retrospective review of all children younger than 18 years who sought medical attention after a dog bite to the face between January 1, 2003 and May 22, 2014 was performed at a large tertiary pediatric hospital. Data on type and location of injury, surgical intervention, and complications were collected. A total of 1,989 children aged 0.19 to 17 years were identified with dog bite s. Dog bite s to the face occurred in most patients (n = 1, 414 [71%]). Of those children with facial dog bite injuries, 230 (16%) suffered ophthalmic manifestations. The average age was 4.3 years. Eyelid injuries occurred in 227 (99%) of children, 47 (20%) sustained canalicular system injuries, 3 (1.3%) suffered corneal abrasions, and 2 patients sustained facial nerve injury resulting in lagophthalmos. No patients suffered vision loss. Complications occurred in 32 patients (14%), with the most common being epiphora in 9 patients (28%), upper eyelid ptosis in 8 (25%), and prominent scar formation in 4 patients (13%). Thirteen children (5.7%) needed one or more secondary procedure to correct complications. The authors report the clinical features and management on the largest series of ophthalmic and periocular injuries associated with pediatric facial dog bite s. These injuries occur in about 1 in 6 dog bite s to the face and primarily involve the ocular adnexa. Despite early and appropriate surgical management, complications and the need for revision surgery are relatively common.
