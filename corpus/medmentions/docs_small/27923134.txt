27923134|t|Evolution: Enhanced Footing for Snake Limb Development
27923134|a|Two groups have studied the loss of limbs in snake evolution by focusing on a long-distance cis-acting enhancer of Sonic Hedgehog. They find a progressive degeneration of binding sites for key transcription factors, mirroring the progressive limblessness occurring in these reptiles.
