28359781|a|In the Netherlands, the prevalence of dietary supplement use has doubled (from 17 to 40 per cent) since the 1980s. Yet, limited data is available on which socio - cognitive factors are associated with dietary supplement use. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to explain dietary supplement use with determinants deriving from the Integrated Change Model (ICM) and from formative research. Socio - cognitive and psychosocial factors were measured among users and non-users of dietary supplements in a longitudinal survey study, with measurements at baseline (N = 1448) and at one-month follow-up (N = 1161). Negative binomial regression analysis was applied to de data. Intention emerged as the main predictor of dietary supplement use (OR = 1.99). Further predictors of dietary supplement use with smaller effect-sizes were: health regulatory focus (promotion, OR = 1.46), social modelling (OR = 1.44), attitude (pros, OR = 1.37), attitude (cons, OR = 0.87), health locus of control (OR = 0.77), and risk perception (chance of getting ill, OR = 1.22). Individuals tend to use dietary supplements if they are promotion oriented, notice dietary supplement users in their social environment, estimate their chances of getting ill higher, and have positive attitude s towards dietary supplements. In contrast, non-users believe that external factors affect their health, and hold negative attitudes towards dietary supplements. Mapping out individuals ' socio - cognitive profile may contribute to the development of online health communication. Based on socio - cognitive and demographical factors, personalised advice can be given about dietary supplement use.
