28074357|t|The Longitudinal Effects of Parenting on Adaptive Behavior in Children with Fragile X Syndrome
28074357|a|Several studies have reported declines in adaptive behavior amongst children with fragile X syndrome (FXS) starting in middle childhood. We examined the effects of maternal responsivity on adaptive behavior in 55 children with FXS visited 5-6 times in their homes from early through middle childhood. Our analyses indicated that sustained maternal responsivity had a significant positive impact on the trajectories of communication and to a lesser extent other adaptive behavior domains through middle childhood with many effects remaining significant after controlling for autism symptoms and developmental level. For children who showed declines in adaptive behavior during middle childhood, sustained high levels of maternal responsivity minimized the amount of decline observed in the communication, socialization, and daily living domains.
