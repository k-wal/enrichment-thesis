28421317|a|The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of oral carbohydrate with amino acid [oral nutritional supplement (ONS)] solution on oxidative stress in healthy persons. Fourteen healthy volunteers were segregated into control and ONS groups. Volunteers in the ONS group ingested 250 ml of Arginaid Water (Nestle Japan, Tokyo, Japan) in the evening before the experiment and at 7:00 am on the day of the experiment. Volunteers in the control group fasted after dinner and drank only water until 7:00 am on the day of the experiment. In both groups, blood was collected at 9:00 am. The serum total oxidant levels and antioxidant capacity were assessed by d-ROMs (derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites) test and BAP (biological antioxidant potential) test, respectively. In the ONS group, the serum d-ROMs level was significantly lower than in the control group (297 ± 43 and 327 ± 41 U.CARR, respectively, p = 0.018), while the serum BAP level was significantly higher than the control group (2410 ± 432 and 1979 ± 397 µmol/l, respectively, p = 0.005). The OXY level of Arginaid Water was much higher than preOp drink (Nutricia, Ireland). In conclusion, our study showed that an ONS with arginine loading could decrease oxidative stress and increase antioxidant capacity in healthy volunteers.
