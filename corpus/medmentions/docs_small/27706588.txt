27706588|t|Assessment of genetic relationship among Rhododendron cultivars using amplified fragment length polymorphism and inter-simple sequence repeat markers
27706588|a|Genetic relationships of 17 Rhododendron cultivars, China, were assessed using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 133 bands were obtained using nine selected ISSR primers, 129 (96.99%) of which were polymorphic; 267 bands were amplified by four AFLP primer pairs, 251 (94.01%) of which exhibited polymorphism. Based on these polymorphic products, a cluster analysis revealed similarities between the results of the ISSR and AFLP. All of the cultivars were clustered into two major branches; one branch contained the same four cultivars, and the other cultivars were separated into different groups in the other branch. The cluster results showed that the genetic relationships of the 17 cultivars were partly related to their morphological characteristics, particularly the flowering phase. Therefore, the results of this study support the classification of Rhododendron cultivars according to flowering phase. In addition, the cluster results can be used to select suitable parents for breeding.
