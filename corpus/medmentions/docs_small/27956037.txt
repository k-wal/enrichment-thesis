27956037|t|Design and synthesis of phosphoryl-substituted diphenylpyrimidines (Pho-DPPYs) as potent Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors: Targeted treatment of B lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines
27956037|a|A family of phosphoryl-substituted diphenylpyrimidine derivatives (Pho-DPPYs) were synthesized and biologically evaluated as potent BTK inhibitors in this study. Compound 7b was found to markedly inhibit BTK activity at concentrations of 0.82nmol/L, as well as to suppress the proliferations of B-cell leukemia cell lines (Ramos and Raji) expressing high levels of BTK at concentrations of 3.17μM and 6.69μM. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis results further indicated that 7b promoted cell apoptosis to a substantial degree. In a word, compound 7b is a promising BTK inhibitor for the treatment of B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia.
