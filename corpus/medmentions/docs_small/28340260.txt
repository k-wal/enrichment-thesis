28340260|t|A study on natural recovery of tassel fertilization and doubling method in maize haploids
28340260|a|Doubling method is the technical barriers in maize haploid breeding. It was very important to establish the independent intellectual property rights for doubling method. In this experiment, the maize haploid inducer, TG15, was used for producing maternal haploids. Also, haploids were obtained from two kinds of maternal genotypes involved in the experiment, including high-oil type and common type. Significant differences were observed among offspring of various genotypes in the recovery of haploid fertilization. In 21 hybrid offspring haploids, the average powder rate was 8.28%, and the seed setting rate was 4.98%. The experimental results showed that when the hybrids were treated with 0.08% colchicine, the average powder rate and seed setting rate of offspring haploids were 35.53 and 20.30%, respectively, which were significantly higher than the hybrids with natural recovery ability. This study primarily established the doubling method of haploids called " bud seedling method " in China which was very practicably in maize doubled haploid breeding.
