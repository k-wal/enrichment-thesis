27383496|t|In vitro genotoxicity of pyridine in human lymphocytes
27383496|a|This work was carried out to study the genotoxicity of pyridine in vitro on human leucocyte culture. Cyclophosphamide, a well-known carcinogen was used as positive control. The four different concentrations of pyridine and cyclophosphamide showed breaks and pulverization of chromosomes in dose dependent manner. Higher number of pulverization was observed with higher concentration of pyridine (3.25Î¼g/mL). Based on this data, our results confirm that both pyridine and its precursor showed genotoxicity against human lymphocytes.
