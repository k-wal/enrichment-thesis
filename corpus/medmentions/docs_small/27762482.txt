27762482|a|Various lasers have been used for the treatment of erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (ETR) that does not respond to systemic or topical therapy. The pulsed dye lasers (PDLs) are an effective option for ETR, and the purpuragenic fluence proved to be superior until now. Given that purpura and subsequent possible postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) are occasionally unbearable in some patients, and several studies using the low nonpurpuragenic fluence were reported. To deliver the sufficient high fluence of a PDL without generating purpura, we designed the fractionation of high fluence using five passes and longer pulse duration (6 milliseconds) of a PDL in succession. A total of eight patients with ETR were enrolled in this study; all patients were treated with PDL 10 times at 2-week intervals. Erythema and telangiectasia scores, as well as improvement, were assessed by two physicians using the digital photographs. Moderate-to-marked improvement was achieved in most of the patients, and erythema and telangiectasia scores were significantly decreased. Purpura and PIH were not reported in all patients. The fractionation of high-fluence, long-pulsed 595 nm PDL is a very safe and effective treatment for ETR.
