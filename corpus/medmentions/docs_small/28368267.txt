28368267|t|Contextual Factors for Stunting Among Children of Age 6 to 24 Months in an Under-Privileged Community of Dhaka, Bangladesh
28368267|a|To determine factors associated with stunting among children aged 6 to 24 months in a slum of Dhaka, Bangladesh. We conducted this case control study during November 2009 to December 2012. Children were classified as case if length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) was <-2 and as control if LAZ was >-1 SD. The logistic regression model was used to find the factors associated with stunting. The significant risk factors for stunting were: child's age >12 months, maternal undernutrition, mother's education <5 years, consumption of untreated drinking water and monthly family income <100 USD. The findings of this study reiterated the role of maternal undernutrition and less education, consumption of untreated drinking water and poor family income as important associated factors of childhood stunting in resource-poor setting.
