27489015|a|Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology is a relatively non-invasive method for diagnosing both superficial and deep-seated neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic utility of trans-oral FNA in cervical (C1 and C2) vertebral and paravertebral lesions. Eighteen FNA cases of cervical vertebral and paravertebral lesions performed by a trans-oral route without any image-guidance between 1995 and 2014 were retrieved from the archives of the cytology department at PGIMER, Chandigarh and reviewed. Out of 18 cases, a definite diagnosis was given in 15 cases (83.3%). The commonest diagnosis seen was granulomatous inflammation consistent with tuberculosis (33.3%). Trans-oral FNA is a quick, inexpensive and relatively safe outpatient procedure for sampling C1 and C2 vertebral and paravertebral lesions, which are clinically and radiologically difficult to approach. It helps in the early diagnosis and management of these patients.
