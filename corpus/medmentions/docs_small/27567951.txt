27567951|t|Hypo-Vascular Liver Metastases Treated with Transarterial chemoembolization: Assessment of Early Response by Volumetric Contrast-Enhanced and Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging
27567951|a|To evaluate the value of anatomic and volumetric functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in early assessment of response to trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hypovascular liver metastases. This retrospective study included 52 metastatic lesions (42 targeted and 10 non-targeted) in 17 patients who underwent MRI before and early after TACE. Two reviewers reported response by anatomic criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor [RECIST], modified RECIST [mRECIST], and European Association for the Study of Liver Disease [EASL]) and functional criteria (volumetric apparent diffusion coefficient and contrast enhancement). treatment endpoint was RECIST at 6 months. A 2-sample paired t test was used to compare the mean changes after intra-arterial therapy. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. Reduction in mRECIST and EASL at 1 month was significant in the whole cohort as well as in responders by RECIST at 6 months, and the changes fulfilled partial response criteria for both metrics in responders. Responders also had significant changes in volumetric apparent diffusion coefficient (P = .01 and P = .03) and contrast enhancement (P < .0001 and P < .0001) at 1 month for both readers, respectively. At 1 month post treatment, responders did not fulfill RECIST criteria but fulfilled mRECIST and EASL criteria. In addition, volumetric contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MRI may be helpful in evaluating early treatment response after TACE in hypovascular liver metastases in patients who have failed to respond to initial chemotherapy.
