28267102|t|Association Between Costs Related to Productivity Loss and Modified Risk Factors Among Users of the Brazilian National Health System
28267102|a|The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between costs related to productivity losses and its risk factors among users of the Brazilian National Health System. The public cost associated with productivity losses of 342 adults has been estimated, taking into account a period of 18 months. Costs related to productivity loss were estimate using data provided by the Brazilian National Health System (disability retirements) and absenteeism. Modifiable risk factors and unhealthy behaviors were assessed through interviews (physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, and smoking) and clinical assessments (obesity). Smoking and physical inactivity affected significantly the amount of money lost with productivity losses related to absenteeism. The presence of obesity generated higher expenditures with disability retirement, while low back pain and sleep disorder were the most relevant confounders in multivariate models for disability retirement and absenteeism. Among users of the Brazilian National Health System, obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity seem to have a significant effect on productivity losses associated with health problems. Moreover, low back pain and sleep quality seem variables few explored but with potential to affect health care costs.
