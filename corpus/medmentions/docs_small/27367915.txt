27367915|t|A case study of the introduction of the International Classification for Nursing Practice (®) in Poland
27367915|a|The development of a nursing practice, improvements in nurses' autonomy, and increased professional and personal responsibility for the medical services provided all require professional documentation with records of health status assessments, decisions undertaken, actions and their outcomes for each patient. The International Classification for Nursing Practice is a tool that meets all of these needs, and although it requires continuous evaluation, it offers professional documentation and communication in the practitioner and researcher community. The aim of this paper is to present a theoretical critique of an issue related to policy and experience of the current situation in Polish nursing - especially of the efforts to standardize nursing practices through the introduction and development of the Classification in Poland. Despite extensive promotion and training by International Council of Nurses members worldwide, there are still many countries where the Classification has not been implemented as a standard tool in healthcare facilities. Recently, a number of initiatives were undertaken in cooperation with the local and state authorities to disseminate the Classification in healthcare facilities. Thanks to intense efforts by the Polish Nurses Association and the International Council of Nurses Accredited Center for ICNP (®) Research & Development at the Medical University of Łódź, the Classification is known in Poland and has been tested at several centres. Nevertheless, an actual implementation that would allow for national and international interoperability requires strategic governmental decisions and close cooperation with information technology companies operating in the country. Discussing the barriers to the implementation of the Classification can improve understanding of it and its use. At a policy level, decision makers need to understand that use Classification in eHealth services and tools it is necessary to achieve interoperability.
