27332346|t|Improving EMR Usability: Critical Elements When Designing Perioperative Emergencies Template
27332346|a|Perianesthesia nursing care involves monitoring of unexpected outcomes before and after surgical and anesthetic procedures. When adverse events occur, reviewing patient data is critical to provide appropriate intervention. Current EMR software systems are limited in structure and are not cohesive in recording adverse events. Users tend to develop workarounds when systems fail to capture workflow. Analysis of adverse incident is incomplete because data entered is not retrievable. Narrative data, while sometimes necessary, cannot easily be analyzed or linked to the structured portion of the record. Designing templates to capture essential data during emergency situations improves usability and compliance. The presentation of information in terms of layout and structure is important because it can influence data retrieval, interpretation and clinical decision making in fundamental ways.
