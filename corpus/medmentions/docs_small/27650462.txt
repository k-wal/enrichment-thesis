27650462|a|Bleeding lesions of the small bowel are often difficult to identify due to the obscure symptomatology. Localizing these lesions requires specific techniques. The Double-balloon enteroscopy (DBE) could be used to precisely localize and mark lesions, so that a minimally invasive surgical treatment could be performed. Twenty robot - assisted small bowel procedures are presented using a combination of DBE for localization and robotic resection. There were 10 jejunal resections and 10 ileal resections. Mean age was 58.7 years. Mean operative time was 153.4 minutes, mean blood loss of 46 mL. No conversion-to-open and there were 4 post-operative complications. The 90- day mortality was nil and the median length of stay was 4.1 days. Final pathology was consistent with malignancy in 10 cases. The combination of double-balloon enteroscopy and robotic technology allows accurate identification and selective treatment of lesions that could be otherwise difficult to treat in a minimally invasive fashion.
