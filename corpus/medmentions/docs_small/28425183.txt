28425183|t|Associations between major life events and adherence, glycemic control, and psychosocial characteristics in teens with type 1 diabetes
28425183|a|This cross-sectional study assessed the type of major life events occurring in a contemporary sample of teens with type 1 diabetes and the association between event frequency and demographic, diabetes management, and psychosocial characteristics. Parents of 178 teens completed the Life Events Checklist to report major events teens had experienced in the last year: 42% experienced 0 to 1 event (n = 75), 32% experienced 2 to 3 events (n = 57), and 26% experienced 4+ events (n = 46). Teens and parents completed validated measures of treatment adherence, diabetes -specific self-efficacy, quality of life, and diabetes -specific family conflict. Parent-youth interview and chart review provided demographics and diabetes management data. Mean number of events / teen was 2.6 Â± 2.7 (range = 0-15). The most common events were " Hospitalization of a family member " (24%), " Getting a bad report card " (20%), "Serious arguments between parents " (19%), and " Serious illness / injury in a family member " (19%). Compared with teens experiencing 0 to 1 event, teens experiencing 4+ events were less likely to have married parents (P = .01) and a parent with a college degree (P = .006). Teen s with 4+ events had significantly poorer adherence (P = .002 teen, P = .02 parent), lower self-efficacy (P = .03 teen, P < .0001 parent), poorer quality of life (P < .0001 teen, P < .0001 parent), and more conflict (P = .006 teen, P = .02 parent) than teens with fewer events. In a multivariate model (R (2) = 0.21, P < .0001) controlling for demographic and diabetes management characteristics, fewer events was associated with lower A1c (P = .0009). Occurrence of more major life events was associated with poorer diabetes care and A1c and more negative psychosocial qualities in teens with type 1 diabetes.
