27691994|t|Determinants of Engagement in Leisure-time Physical Activity - Dialogue with Senior Athletes
27691994|a|This article explores the factors determining whether older adults engage in the Senior Games and related leisure-time physical activity through examining the adults ' salient beliefs. We conducted 10 in-depth interviews with older adults who have participated in the Senior Games. Underpinned by the planned behavior theory's framework, we explored three types of beliefs: advantages and disadvantages (behavioral beliefs), social support and pressure (normative beliefs), and facilitators and impediments (control beliefs). Interview respondents were found to engage in the Senior Games and related physical activity to the extent that they associated various intangible advantages with the games and valued psychological satisfaction. They viewed their peers and families as supporting and approving of their engagement and recognized the physical capabilities required, and structural constraints necessary, to engage in the games and related activity. With these findings, pertinent beliefs can be combined with interventions designed to encourage leisure-time physical activities by older adults.
