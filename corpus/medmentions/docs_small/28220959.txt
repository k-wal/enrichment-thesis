28220959|t|Evaluating clinical, dietary and psychological risk factors for relapse of ulcerative colitis in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission
28220959|a|The literature on possible factors that could trigger a relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission on long term follow up is scarce. To determine the relapse rate in patients with UC in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission and identify factors that may influence the risk of relapse. Patients with UC in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission were enrolled between January-July 2010 and followed up for 1 year to determine the effect of clinical, dietary and psychological factors on relapse. Information regarding factors that may affect relapse such as infection, antibiotic or NSAIDs use and any other factor which the patient felt important, and compliance with medications was obtained. 97 patients (59 males, mean age 39 + 11.9 years) were followed up for a mean duration of 9 + 2.3 months. 18(18.6%) relapsed with the median time to relapse being 3.5 months. On univariate analysis more relapsers had significantly higher NSAIDs use within 15 days of relapse, respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks, use of steroids more than once in past, higher consumption of calcium, riboflavin, vitamin A and lower consumption of sugars. On multivariate analysis, NSAIDs use [HR(95%CI):6.41(1.88-21.9)]and intake of Vitamin A [HR(95%CI):1.008(1.000-1.016)] were statistically significant predictors of relapse. With a relapse rate of 18.6% over a follow up of 9 months in patients with UC in clinical, endoscopic and histological remission, independent predictors of relapse were history of NSAIDs use within 15 days of relapse and higher intake of Vitamin A.
