27438230|a|Late toxic effects are common after definitive radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy for oropharynx cancer and are considered a significant contributor to decreased quality of life for survivors. The incidence of severe late toxic effects may be reduced by modern narrow-margin image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IG-IMRT), current supportive care improvements, and the changing epidemiology of oropharynx cancer. Assess the incidence of severe late toxic effects after modern definitive non-operative treatment for oropharynx cancer. For this single-institution retrospective review, 156 patients with stage I-IVB squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx treated between April 2009 and February 2015 at a tertiary-referral academic multidisciplinary head and neck practice were recruited. Definitive narrow-margin IG-IMRT to a dose of 66 Gy (to convert milligray to rad, multiply by 0.1) or higher with or without concurrent cisplatin. The primary outcome was the prospectively collected 2- year cumulative incidence of severe late toxic effects (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or higher) occurring 3 months or more after radiotherapy. Toxic effect end points investigated included esophageal stricture requiring dilation, aspiration pneumonia hospitalization, vocal dysfunction, delayed feeding tube insertions, and osteoradionecrosis. Feeding tube dependence at 1 year was also considered a severe late toxic effect. Secondary outcomes collected include physician -reported grade 2 or higher neck fibrosis and xerostomia. The competing risks of recurrence and death were accounted for using the Gray method. One-hundred fifty-six patients (median [range] age, 58 [37-96] years) were identified; 130 patients (83%) were HPV positive. Concurrent cisplatin was delivered in 131 patients (84%) and 5 patients (3%) underwent an adjuvant neck dissection. The median (range) follow-up for survivors was 22 (4-73) months from diagnosis. The projected 2- year locoregional control was 93% (95% CI, 88.4%-97.6%) and overall survival was 88% (95% CI, 82.2%-94.0%). Thirty-eight patients (23%) required a feeding tube during treatment. The cumulative incidence of severe late toxic effects adjusted for competing risks at 2- year posttreatment was 2.3% (95% CI, 0%-5.6%). One patient required free-flap reconstruction for grade 3 osteoradionecrosis at 47 months. At 1 year, 2 patients (1%) experienced grade 2 neck fibrosis and 38 patients (23%) experienced grade 2 xerostomia. These results suggest that severe late toxic effects after modern definitive IG-IMRT, with or without cisplatin, for oropharynx cancer is likely uncommon. The importance of late toxic effect reduction in current and future investigational strategies, including clinical trials, should be considered.
