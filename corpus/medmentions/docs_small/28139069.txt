28139069|a|Myzus persicae s.l. is a major crop pest globally and has evolved resistance to a range of insecticide classes making it increasingly difficult to control in some areas. Here we compare bioassay monitoring data for two important compounds, imidacloprid and spirotetramat, on field samples / clones collected in Greece. A total of 122 aphid samples / clones from central and northern Greece were examined in dose-response bioassays with imidacloprid. There was an overall increase in the level of resistance (resistance factor = 15-40) within tobacco - collected samples from 78.7% in 2007 to 86.7% in 2015. The corresponding frequencies for peach samples were 13.3% and 6.7%. These results were confounded however by the first identification of the R81T target mutation in Greece during 2015 (4.3% as heterozygotes in peach) and 2016 (21.3% as heterozygotes in peach). No resistance to spirotetramat was found at the 60 clones collected in 2015. Resistance to imidacloprid is continuing to increase within Greek M. persicae s.l. populations and the situation is likely to deteriorate further with the recent identification of the R81T resistance mutation. Resistance to spirotetramat has not been found and is therefore a good alternative to neonicotinoids for resistance management. Â© 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.
