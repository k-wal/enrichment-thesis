28161405|a|Although staged repair for reconstructing severe hypospadias is more popular, various one-stage repairs have been attempted. Koyanagi repair (parameatal-based and fully extended circumferential foreskin flap urethroplasty) has enabled correction of severe hypospadias in one stage. However, its un-acceptably high incidence of complications has initiated a series of technical modifications, including the "yoke" repair. To retrospectively analyze the outcome of a proposed modification of the originally described yoke repair, for patients with severe hypospadias. This modification was developed to reduce complications. Over 4 years (between Jan 2011 and Jan 2015), all cases of severe hypospadias were included in this study; except those with prior attempts at repair, circumcised cases, and cases with severe hypogonadism - because of partial androgen insensitivity - not responding to hormonal manipulations. The make-up of the neo-urethra in this modification is the urethral plate with its spongiosal tissue proximally, a circum-coronal preputial pedicled flap in the middle, and an incorporated part of the augmented preputial flap and the preserved V-shaped glanular urethra, distally. Close postoperative follow-up was conducted to investigate the outcome. Thirty-one children with a median age of 32.48 months had repair of severe hypospadias using the neo-yoke technique. After a median follow-up of 26.7 months, the overall complication rate was 16.1%. Four children developed urethrocutaneous fistula (12.9%). Meatal drop-back occurred in one case (3.2%). No meatal stenosis or urethral sacculation was detected during follow-up of the studied group. Almost all cases had cosmetically appealing outlook. Single-staged repair of severe hypospadias using parameatal foreskin - based urethroplasty has passed through different modifications, all aimed at optimizing the outcome (Table). Neo-yoke repair for severe hypospadias is a natural development of established one-stage techniques, which resulted in better mid-term outcomes. However, an extended study is needed to declare the long-term results.
