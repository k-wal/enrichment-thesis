28269712|t|Heart rate variability as a biomarker for sedation depth estimation in ICU patients
28269712|a|An automated patient-specific system to classify the level of sedation in ICU patients using heart rate variability signal is presented in this paper. ECG from 70 mechanically ventilated adult patients with administered sedatives in an ICU setting were used to develop a support vector machine based system for sedation depth monitoring using several heart rate variability measures. A leave-one-subject-out cross validation was used for classifier training and performance evaluations. The proposed patient-specific system provided a sensitivity, specificity and an AUC of 64%, 84.8% and 0.72, respectively. It is hoped that with the help of additional physiological signals the proposed patient - specific sedation level prediction system could lead to a fully automated multimodal system to assist clinical staff in ICUs to interpret the sedation level of the patient.
