28393600|t|Shell design and reaming technique affect deformation in mobile-bearing total hip arthroplasty acetabular components
28393600|a|Press-fit acetabular components are susceptible to rim deformation. The inherent variability within acetabular reaming techniques may generate increased press-fit and, subsequently, additional component deformation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the insertion and deformation characteristics of acetabular components designed for dual-mobility systems based on component design, size, and reaming technique. Shell deformation was quantified in a validated worst-case scenario foam pinch model. Thin-walled, one-piece, and modular dual-mobility shells of varying size were implanted in under- and over-reamed cavities with insertion force measured and shell deformation assessed using digital image correlation. Increased shell size resulted in larger rim deformation in one-piece components, with a reduction in press-fit by 1 mm resulting in up to 48% reduction in insertion forces and between 23% and 51% reduction in shell deformation. Lower insertion force s and deformations were observed in modular components. Variability in acetabular reaming plays a significant role in the ease of implantation and component deformation in total hip arthroplasty. Modular components are less susceptible to deformation than thin-walled monoblock shells. Care should be taken to avoid excessive under-reaming, particularly in the scenario of large shell size and high - density patient bone stock.
