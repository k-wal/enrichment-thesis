27521864|a|Blood transfusions are one of the most performed medical procedures in the world. Thus, as education in transfusion medicine is vital to medical care, it should aim to promote a responsible practice with the rational use of blood by doctors. This study aims to investigate the situation of the teaching of transfusion medicine in medical schools in Brazil. The websites of the 249 Brazilian medical schools in operation in June 2015 were visited and the curricula of the medical courses were investigated in respect to the presence or absence of a transfusion medicine discipline. When available, the subject grids were analyzed to verify whether a description of content regarding transfusion medicine was given within other disciplines. Of the 249 medical school sites visited, information on the curriculum was obtained from 178. Of the medical schools that published their curriculum, 132 (74.1%) did not have disciplines of transfusion medicine or hematology and only seven (3.9%) had a discipline of transfusion medicine in the curricular grid. Education on transfusion medicine is of fundamental importance for safe and efficient transfusion practices. Deficiencies in medical knowledge of this subject have been found worldwide. The results of this study indicate a possible deficiency in teaching the basics of this specialty. Thus, additional prospective studies to assess the knowledge and practice of transfusion medicine in Brazilian medical schools are warranted, which could prompt a discussion on the importance of offering training in transfusion medicine to medical students.
