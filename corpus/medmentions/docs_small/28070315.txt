28070315|t|Evaluation of analytical methods for the determination of the physicochemical properties of fermented, granulated, and roasted cassava pulp - gari
28070315|a|Simple but reliable methods for the determination of the physicochemical properties of gari were evaluated for the parameters, such as grain size, bulk density, swelling index, moisture content, gross calorific value, cyanide content, and acidity content. The grain sizes were between 525 and 928 μm (weighted means), the bulk densities between 0.541 and 0.699 g/cm³, and the swelling indices between 3.21 and 4.33. The moisture contents ranged from 4.30 to 9.19%. The gross calorific values were found between 15.45 and 15.82 kJ/g. The cyanide contents were between 0 and 4.8 ppm. The acidity contents varied among 0.55 and 1.62%. Correlation tests verified the influences of the grain size and the moisture content on the acidity content with a probability of 99.9%. The methods were regarded as suitable and adaptable for the application in small and medium cassava - processing industries with special regard to the respect of the consumer `s health safety.
