28055920|t|Robust DLPP With Nongreedy ℓ₁$-Norm Minimization and Maximization
28055920|a|Recently, discriminant locality preserving projection based on L1-norm (DLPP-L1) was developed for robust subspace learning and image classification. It obtains projection vectors by greedy strategy, i.e., all projection vectors are optimized individually through maximizing the objective function. Thus, the obtained solution does not necessarily best optimize the corresponding trace ratio optimization algorithm, which is the essential objective function for general dimensionality reduction. It results in insufficient recognition accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose a nongreedy algorithm to solve the trace ratio formula of DLPP-L1, and analyze its convergence. Experimental results on three databases illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.
