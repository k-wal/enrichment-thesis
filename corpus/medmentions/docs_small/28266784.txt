28266784|t|Ethnic disparities relative to disease features and outcomes in children with acute myeloid leukemia
28266784|a|Hispanics with acute leukemias have poorer outcomes than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), despite an increased likelihood of favorable prognostic features. We reviewed medical records from 167 children ages 0-18 years diagnosed with de novo AML over an 18-year period at Texas Children's Cancer Center, among whom 129 self-identified as Hispanic or NHW. Although Hispanics were significantly more likely to have the favorable prognostic cytogenetic feature t(8;21) (P = 0.04), the expected survival benefit was not observed. This lack of survival benefit was primarily due to significantly poorer event-free and overall survival among Hispanics treated with upfront stem cell transplantation after achieving first clinical remission (P = 0.008).
