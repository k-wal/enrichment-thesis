27847549|a|Objective:To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a novel hydrogen peroxide -based regimen versus a benzoyl peroxide -based regimen in mild-to-moderate acne. Methods: In this eight- week multicenter study, patients were randomized to either a hydrogen peroxide -based or a benzoyl peroxide -based regimen .The primary outcome measure of clinical response was assessed using the Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) at baseline ,four weeks, and eight weeks. At Week 8, a patient self-satisfaction questionnaire was administered. Investigators were also queried at that time regarding assessment of tolerability and cosmetic acceptability. Tolerability was also measured at each visit. Results: Both treatment regimens were associated with improvement of GAGS score at Week 8 compared to baseline (p<0.0001). GAGS score did not differ significantly between the two regimens over the same period (p=0.7765). No significant adverse events were reported or observed in either treatment arm. Both patients and investigators found both regimens to be similarly effective and cosmetically acceptable. Conclusion: A novel hydrogen peroxide -based regimen was shown to be comparable in efficacy, safety, and cosmetic acceptability to a benzoyl peroxide -based regimen in the treatment of mild-to-moderate acne.
