28098263|t|A lab-on-a-chip for monolith -based preconcentration and electrophoresis separation of phosphopeptides
28098263|a|A microdevice combining online preconcentration and separation of phosphopeptides was developed in a glass microchip. An ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate (EGMP), acrylamide (AM) and bisacrylamide (BAA) based monolith was synthesized within microchannels through a photo-driven process. Morphological investigations revealed a homogeneous monolithic structure composed of uniform nodules (∼0.8 μm), with a large pore volume (0.62 cm(3) g(-1)) and sufficiently high specific surface area (34.1 m(2) g(-1)). These features make the monolith particularly interesting for preconcentration purposes. Immobilization of Zr(4+) ions on the phosphate groups present at the poly(EGMP-co-AM-co-BAA) monolith surface leads to immobilized metal affinity chromatography support. This monolith - Zr(4+) showed a great capacity to capture phosphopeptides. Successful preconcentration and separation of a mixture of ERK2 derived peptides differing only by their phosphorylation degree and sites could be achieved with signal enhancement factors between 340 and 910 after only 7 min of preconcentration. This integrated microdevice represents a novel approach for phosphoproteomic applications.
