27829875|t|Mildly raised tricuspid regurgitant velocity 2.5-3.0 m/s in pregnant women with sickle cell disease is not associated with poor obstetric outcome - An observational cross-sectional study
27829875|a|Pulmonary hypertension is associated with 36% mortality in pregnancy, and 6-10% of patients with sickle cell disease have pulmonary hypertension. Tricuspid regurgitant velocity ≥2.5 m/s on echocardiography is a well validated means of screening for pulmonary hypertension in the non-pregnant population. This is a pilot study to determine if this is a useful non-invasive screening test for pulmonary hypertension in pregnancy, and whether raised tricuspid regurgitant velocity ≥2.5 m/s was associated with poor outcomes. This is a cross-sectional study over a five-year period in a tertiary referral centre with a specialised multidisciplinary clinic for pregnant women with sickle cell disease. Women with sickle cell disease, no prior pulmonary hypertension and singleton pregnancies who had echocardiography with a measurable tricuspid regurgitant velocity in pregnancy were included. There were 34 pregnancies, of which eight had tricuspid regurgitant velocity ≥2.5 m/s. There were no significant differences in their characteristics, sickle cell -related complications or medical co-morbidities. The women with tricuspid regurgitant velocity ≥2.5 m/s had similar obstetric and perinatal outcomes as those with a tricuspid regurgitant velocity <2.5 m/s.
