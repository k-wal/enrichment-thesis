28108814|t|The small neurotoxin apamin blocks not only small conductance Ca(2+) activated K(+) channels (SK type) but also the voltage dependent Kv1.3 channel
28108814|a|Apamin is frequently used as a specific blocker of small-conductance Ca(2+)-activated (SK type) K(+) channels. Here we show that the small neurotoxin is not as specific as anticipated. It is also a high-affinity inhibitor with an IC50 of 13 nM of the Kv1.3 channel; it blocks the latter with potency similar to the Kv1.3 blocker PAP-1. Since SK type channels and Kv1.3 channels are frequently coexpressed in different tissues such as cells of the immune system, apamin must be used with caution as a pharmacological tool.
