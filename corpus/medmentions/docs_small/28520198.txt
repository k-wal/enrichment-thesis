28520198|a|To demonstrate the feasibility of oxygen - dependent relaxometry in human lung using an inversion recovery ultra-fast steady-state free precession (IR-ufSSFP) technique. Electrocardiogram-triggered pulmonary relaxometry with IR-ufSSFP was performed in 7 healthy human subjects at 1.5 T. The data were acquired under both normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. In a single breath - hold of less than 9 seconds, 30 transient state IR-ufSSFP images were acquired, yielding longitudinal (T1) and transversal (T2) relaxometry parameter maps using voxel -wise nonlinear fitting. Possible spatial misalignments between consecutive IR-ufSSFP parameter maps were corrected using elastic image registration. Furthermore, dynamic relaxometry oxygen wash-in and wash-out scans were performed in one volunteer. From this, T1 -related wash-in and wash-out time constants (τwi, τwo) were calculated voxel -wise on registered maps using an exponential fitting model. For healthy lung, observed T1 values were 1399 ± 77 and 1290 ± 76 ms under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions, respectively. Oxygen -related reduction of T1 was statistically significant in every volunteer. No statistically significant change, however, was observed in T2, with normoxic and hyperoxic T2 values of 55 ± 16 and 56 ± 17 ms, respectively. The observed average τwi was 87.0 ± 28.7 seconds, whereas the average τwo was 73.5 ± 21.6 seconds. IR-ufSSFP allows fast, steady-state, and dynamic oxygen - dependent relaxometry of the human lung.
