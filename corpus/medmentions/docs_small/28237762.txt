28237762|t|Synthesis, SAR and molecular docking study of novel non-β-lactam inhibitors of TEM type β-lactamase
28237762|a|The novel classes of acylated phenoxyanilide and thiourea compounds were investigated for their ability to inhibit TEM type β-lactamase enzyme. Two compounds 4g and 5c reveal the inhibition potency in micromolar range and show their action by non-covalent binding in the vicinity of the TEM-171 active site. The structure activity relationship around carbon chain length and different substituents in ortho- and para-positions of acylated phenoxyanilide as well as molecular modelling study has been performed.
