28077046|t|Rational use of rasburicase for the treatment and management of tumor lysis syndrome
28077046|a|Purpose There is a lack of high-level evidence identifying meaningful outcomes and the optimal place in therapy of rasburicase in patients with, or at high risk for tumor lysis syndrome. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate and characterize outcomes resulting from an institution-specific guideline emphasizing supportive care, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, and lower doses of rasburicase. Methods In this retrospective chart review, we compared conservative rasburicase dosing, in accordance with newly developed UMHS tumor lysis syndrome guidelines, with aggressive rasburicase in adult patients (â‰¥ 18 years of age) with hematological or solid tumor malignancies, and a uric acid level between 8 and 15 mg/dL. The primary efficacy outcome assessed the difference in the proportion of patients achieving a uric acid level <8 mg/dL within 48 h using a one-sided noninferiority test. The principle safety outcomes analyzed included incidence of acute kidney injury and hemodialysis requirement. Results One hundred sixty-one patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the study. Within 48 h of an elevated uric acid level, treatment was successful in 97.03% of patients in the conservative group, as compared with 98.33% in the aggressive group (difference, 1.3 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -3.33 to 5.93). Furthermore, there was no difference in the proportion of patients requiring hemodialysis (2.97% vs. 10.0%, p-value 0.079), or incidence of acute kidney injury (4.0% vs. 12.5%, p-value 1.00) between the treatment group and control group, respectively. Conclusions Conservative rasburicase use was noninferior to aggressive rasburicase use in patients with or at high risk for tumor lysis syndrome.
