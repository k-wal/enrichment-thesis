28271600|a|Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery is an emerging technique. We aimed to develop an advanced surgical robot mechanism for natural orifice surgery. We propose the active-controlled overtube-type platform with multiple channels for an endoscopic camera and surgical tools. To make such a platform, we suggest an advanced snake mechanism comprising movable pulleys to make a snake mechanism with multiple degrees of freedom and high operating force. The stiffness and maneuverability of the active-controlled platform appeared satisfactory. Using prototypes and ex vivo experiments, we confirmed that the mechanism was suitable for a snake-like robotic platform for natural orifice surgery. The suggested snake mechanism using movable pulleys has the advantages of stiffness and maneuverability. This new mechanism can be an alternative platform for natural orifice surgery.
