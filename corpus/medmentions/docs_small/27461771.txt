27461771|t|Chelation competition induced polymerization (CCIP): construction of integrated hollow polydopamine nanocontainers with tailorable functionalities
27461771|a|A novel ' chelation competition induced polymerization ' route was developed to construct hollow polydopamine nanocontainers with tailorable functionalities. The mechanism is systematically investigated and the nanocontainers constructed through this method show excellent chemo-thermo performance in vitro. This strategy is facile and is expected to be used for the construction of a series of hollow polymer nanostructures.
