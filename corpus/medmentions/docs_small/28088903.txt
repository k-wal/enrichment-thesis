28088903|a|Due to the importance of nature as a source of new drug candidates, the purpose of this article is to emphasize the marine natural products, which exhibit antitubercular activity, published between January 2000 and May 2016, with 138 quotation to 250 compounds obtained from marine resources. These metabolites are organized by chemical constitution and named as simple alkyl lipids derivatives, aromatics derivatives, peptides, alkaloids, terpenoids, steroids, macrolides, and polycyclic polyketides.
