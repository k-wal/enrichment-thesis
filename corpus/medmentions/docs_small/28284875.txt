28284875|t|Bioengineered 3D Models for Studying Human Cell - Tuberculosis Interactions
28284875|a|In vivo animal models have intrinsic limitations for studying relationships between tuberculosis and its host and there is a need for alternative, in vitro cellular models. A microsphere -based 3D in vitro culture system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis -infected human blood mononuclear cells was reported to address specific aspects of host - pathogen interactions.
