27524875|a|The imaging of dysregulated cell-surface receptors (or biomarkers) is a potential means of identifying the presence of cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. However, due to heterogeneities in the expression of protein biomarkers in tumors, molecular imaging technologies should ideally be capable of visualizing a multiplexed panel of cancer biomarkers. Recently, surface-enhanced Raman-scattering (SERS) nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted wide interest due to their potential for sensitive and multiplexed biomarker detection. In this review, we focus on the most recent advances in tumor imaging using SERS -coded NPs. A brief introduction of the structure and optical properties of SERS NPs is provided, followed by a detailed discussion of key imaging issues such as the administration of NPs in tissue (topical versus systemic), the optical configuration and imaging approach of Raman imaging systems, spectral demultiplexing methods for quantifying NP concentrations, and the disambiguation of specific vs. nonspecific sources of contrast through ratiometric imaging of targeted and untargeted (control) NP pairs. Finally, future challenges and directions are briefly outlined.
