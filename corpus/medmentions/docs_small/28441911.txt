28441911|a|The maximum surgical blood ordering schedule (MSBOS) provides guidelines for pre-operative pre-transfusion testing for elective surgical procedures. This study compared blood ordering and utilization during the period when the MSBOS was created by achieving consensus between the blood bank and the various surgical specialties, and after the introduction of an MSBOS created by using department-specific red blood cell (RBC) transfusion data (data driven MSBOS, dMSBOS). The dMSBOS was created by analyzing 12 months of RBC transfusion data for each procedure across a regional health system. Pre-transfusion testing and the RBC crossmatch: transfusion (C:T) ratios at 8 of the hospitals were compared between the 12 month period before the dMSBOS was introduced, and the 15 months after its introduction. There were significant reductions in the median monthly number of type and screens not associated with RBC crossmatches (10 714-10 061; p < 0.0001) and the median number of type and screens associated with RBC crossmatches (10 127-9 349; p = 0.0014) on surgical patients after dMSBOS implementation. There were significant decreases in the median number of monthly RBC units crossmatched (2 981-2 444; p < 0.0001) and transfused (890-791; p < 0.0001) to surgical patients after implementing the dMSBOS. The overall system-wide C:T ratio trended down after dMSBOS implementation (from 3.34 to 3.17, p = 0.067). Crossmatching fewer RBC units facilitates more efficient management of the blood bank's inventory. The dMSBOS was effective in reducing the extent of unnecessary pre-transfusion testing before surgery and reduced the number of RBCs that were crossmatched for specific patients.
