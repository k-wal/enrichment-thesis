28002691|t|The Silorane-based Resin Composites: A Review
28002691|a|This article aims to review the research done on the silorane-based resin composites (SBRC) regarding polymerization shrinkage and contraction stresses and their ability to improve the shortcomings of the methacrylate-based resin composites (MRBC). Special attention is given to their physical and mechanical properties, bond strength, marginal adaptation, and cusp deflection. The clinical significance of this material is critically appraised with a focus on the ability of SBRC to strengthen the tooth structure as a direct restorative material. A search of English peer-reviewed dental literature (2003-2015) from PubMed and MEDLINE databases was conducted with the terms " low shrinkage " and " silorane composites ." The list was screened, and 70 articles that were relevant to the objectives of this work were included.
