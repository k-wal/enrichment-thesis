28274070|t|A Rare Case Report of Spindle Cell Ameloblastic Carcinoma Involving the Mandible
28274070|a|Ameloblastic Carcinoma (AC) is uncommon malignant epithelial odontogenic tumour of jaw, with characteristic histologic features and behavior. Clinically, it has aggressive, infiltrative growth pattern with a distinct predilection for mandible. It exhibits histologic features of ameloblastoma and gets dedifferentiated overtime to culminate in carcinoma. Majority of the cases arise denovo (primary) and only few cases arise from a pre-existing ameloblastoma (secondary). Spindle-cell differentiation in ameloblastic carcinoma is rare; Salter described it as a separate entity " low-grade spindle cell ameloblastic carcinoma. Here we report a case of 32- year-old female patient who presented with a swelling present for past six months. It was diagnosed as Spindle cell Ameloblastic Carcinoma (SpAC), after the hemimandibulectomy the patient was under regular follow up for 14 months, no sign of recurrence was seen.
