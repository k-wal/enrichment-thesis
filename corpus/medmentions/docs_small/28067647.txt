28067647|t|Decomposition of xenobiotics during visible light irradiation in the presence of immobilised photosensitisers: kinetics study
28067647|a|The objective of this work was to study the photosensitised oxidation of the xenobiotics benzylparaben (BeP) and 2,4dichlorophenol (2,4DCP) in aqueous solutions using photosensitisers immobilised into chitosan carrier particles and visible light radiation. Zn(II) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate tetrasodium salt and Al(III) phthalocyanine chloride tetrasulfonic acid were used as photosensitisers. The major role of the singlet oxygen during photodegradation was proven by using scavengers of reactive oxygen species. The influence of initial xenobiotic concentration and temperature on degradation rate was examined. The investigations were focused on kinetics (Langmuir-Hinshelwood model) as well as activation energy determination. Moreover, the adsorption isotherms of BeP and 2,4DCP into chitosan carrier were determined using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller model.
