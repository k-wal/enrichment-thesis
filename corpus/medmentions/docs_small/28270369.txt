28270369|a|The aim of this study was to examine the reliability and validity of Turkish version of Diabetes Eating Problem Survey-Revised (DEPS-R) for children and adolescent with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. A total of 200 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, ages 9-18 years, completed the DEPS-R Turkish version. In addition to tests of validity, confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to investigate the factor structure of the 16-item Turkish version of DEPS-R. The Turkish version of DEPS-R demonstrated satisfactory Cronbach's ‚àù (0.847) and was significantly correlated with ag e (r=0.194; p<0.01), hemoglobin A1c levels (r=0.303; p<0.01) and BMI - SDS (r=0.412; p<0.01) indicating criterion validity. Median DEPS-R scores of Turkish version for the total samples, females and males were as follows: 11.0, 11.5 and 10.5 respectively. Disturbed eating behaviors and insulin restriction were associated with poor metabolic control. A short, self-administered diabetes specific screening tool for disordered eating behavior can be used routinely in the clinical care of adolescents with type 1 diabetes. The Turkish version of DEPS-R is a valid screening tool for disordered eating behaviors in type 1 diabetes and it is potentially important to early detect disordered eating behaviors.
