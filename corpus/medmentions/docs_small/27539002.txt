27539002|t|Effects of Smoke Generated by Electrocautery on the Larynx
27539002|a|The aim of this study was to investigate effects of smoke produced by electrocautery on the laryngeal mucosa. We used 16 healthy, adult female Wistar albino rats. We divided the rats into two groups. Eight rats were exposed to smoke for 60 min/d for 4 weeks, and eight rats were not exposed to smoke and served as controls. The experimental group was maintained in a plexiglass cabin during exposure to smoke. At the end of 4 weeks, rats were sacrificed under high-dose ketamine anesthesia. Each vocal fold was removed. An expert pathologist blinded to the experimental group evaluated the tissues for the following: epithelial distribution, inflammation, hyperplasia, and metaplasia. Mucosal cellular activities were assessed by immunohistochemical staining for Ki67. Results taken before and after effect were compared statistically. There was a significant difference in the extent of inflammation between the experimental group and the control group. Squamous metaplasia was detected in each group, but the difference was not significant. None of the larynges in either group developed hyperplasia. We showed increased tissue inflammation due to irritation by the smoke.
