27832736|t|Facial Likability and Smiling Enhance Cooperation, but Have No Direct Effect on Moralistic Punishment
27832736|a|The present study serves to test how positive and negative appearance -based expectations affect cooperation and punishment. Participants played a prisoner's dilemma game with partners who either cooperated or defected. Then they were given a costly punishment option: They could spend money to decrease the payoffs of their partners. Aggregated over trials, participants spent more money for punishing the defection of likable - looking and smiling partners compared to punishing the defection of unlikable - looking and nonsmiling partners, but only because participants were more likely to cooperate with likable - looking and smiling partners, which provided the participants with more opportunities for moralistic punishment. When expressed as a conditional probability, moralistic punishment did not differ as a function of the partners ' facial likability. Smiling had no effect on the probability of moralistic punishment, but punishment was milder for smiling in comparison to nonsmiling partners.
