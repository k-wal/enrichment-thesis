27391754|t|Role of the Membrane for Mechanosensing by Tethered Channels
27391754|a|Biologically important membrane channels are gated by force at attached tethers. Here, we generically characterize the nontrivial interplay of force, membrane tension, and channel deformations that can affect gating. A central finding is that minute conical channel deformation under force leads to significant energy release during opening. We also calculate channel-channel interactions and show that they can amplify the force sensitivity of tethered channels.
