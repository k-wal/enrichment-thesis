28528555|t|Development and Evaluation of the ADHD Cognitions Scale for Adults
28528555|a|The clinical literature on ADHD in adults suggests that " overly positive " or optimistic cognitions may contribute to impairment and failure to use self-regulation skills in this population, yet the research literature on this topic is limited. We developed the ADHD Cognitions Scale (ACS), a brief self-report measure of ADHD -related thoughts, and evaluated its psychometric properties. We collected self-report measures, inculding the ACS, from two large community samples (Ns = 262, 304). The measure demonstrated a one-factor solution that replicated in the second sample. Evidence of good internal consistency and also convergent and divergent validity was obtained for both samples. Scores on the ACS correlated with functional impairment, time management problems, and avoidant coping strategies. With additional study, the ACS may be useful to identify and track maladaptive ADHD -related cognitions during cognitive-behavioral treatment, and to further study the role of these thoughts in ADHD -related impairment.
