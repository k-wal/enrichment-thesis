27347631|t|Retroperitoneal hemorrhage after ureteroscopy without laser lithotripsy: an extreme example of an underreported event?
27347631|a|Retroperitoneal hemorrhage and an associated hematoma are uncommon but potentially serious complications following ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy. However, no reports of serious bleeding complications have been published regarding ureteroscopy without laser lithotripsy in the management of stone disease. We report of such a case here and then review the current literature in order to discuss the incidence, risk factors, and management of such events.
