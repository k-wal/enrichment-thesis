27792137|t|Determination of Deoxynivalenol in the Urine of Pregnant Women in the UK
27792137|a|Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most commonly occurring trichothecenes, produced mainly by Fusarium graminearum. Little is known about the effect of DON exposure or the levels of DON exposure that occur during pregnancy. The project aimed to provide data on levels of total DON and de-epoxi Deoxynivalenol (DOM-1) in pregnant human urine samples analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Morning urine samples were collected over two consecutive days from 42 volunteers and associated food consumption was recorded for the 24 h prior to the sample. Spearman's rho non-parametric test for correlation was used to assess the data. Levels of DON did not differ significantly between day 1 (mean 29.7 ng/mL urine or 40.1 ng DON /mg creatinine) and day 2 (mean 28.7 ng/mL urine or 38.8 ng DON /mg creatinine ng/mL/ day) urine samples. The only significant positive correlation was found between total ng DON /mg creatinine and parity (rho = 0.307, n = 42, p < 0.005 two-tailed) and total ng DON /mg creatinine with baked goods on day 1 (rho = 0.532, n = 42, p < 0.0005 two-tailed). This study provides data on the DON levels in pregnancy in this suburban population and reassurance that those levels are within acceptable limits.
