28111056|t|Increased morbidity, mortality and length of in-hospital stay for patients with acute coronary syndrome with pre-morbid psychiatric diagnoses
28111056|a|Psychiatric and cardiac comorbidities form the top two budget categories for health systems in high - income countries with evidence that psychiatric pre-morbidities lead to worse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). There are no studies examining this relationship in a national multicentre population level study in the UK, and no studies examining their impact on length of in-hospital stay (LoS) in ACS. Recognizing at-risk populations and reducing LoS in ACS is an essential part of improving patient care and cost-effectiveness. We investigated the impact of psychiatric diagnoses on morbidity, all-cause mortality and LoS amongst 57,668 ACS patients between Jan -2004 and Dec -2014 using the Secure-Anonymized-Information-Linkage (SAIL) databank. Demographics, admissions, cardiac and psychiatric comorbidities were identified using coded data. There were a total of 3857 out of 57,668 patients who had a pre-morbid psychiatric diagnosis. The mean LoS in patients without psychiatric comorbidities was 9.78 days (95% CI: 9.66-9.91). This was higher (p<0.01) in the presence of any psychiatric diagnosis (14.72), dementia (20.87), schizophrenia (15.67), and mood disorders (13.41). Patients with psychiatric comorbidities had worse net adverse cardiac events (HR 1.18, 95% CI: 1.16-1.21) and mortality rates (HR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.23-1.30). Our results demonstrate that psychiatric comorbidities have a significant and clinically important impact on morbidity, mortality and LoS in ACS patients in Wales, UK. Clinicians ' awareness and active management of psychiatric conditions amongst ACS patients is needed to reduce poor outcomes and LoS and ultimately the risk for patients and financial burden for the health-service.
