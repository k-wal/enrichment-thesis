28169040|t|Os subtibiale: Mimicking medial malleolar fracture a report of three cases and review of literature
28169040|a|There are numerous sesamoids and accessory ossicles around the foot which can easily be misdiagnosed as fractures. Os subtibiale is a very rare normal variant of the medial malleolus which is usually diagnosed incidentally in routine ankle radiographs. In this report, we present a case series of 3 patients with os subtibiale who were admitted to the emergency department with ankle sprains and misdiagnosed as medial malleolar fractures. We would like to raise awareness to the very rare and usually asymptomatic os subtibiale as a diagnostic pitfall.
