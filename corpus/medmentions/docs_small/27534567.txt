27534567|a|Punch injuries are a form of self-harm characterised by the intentional act of striking an object with a closed fist. We aimed to describe the characteristics and trends in young people presenting with injuries sustained via the punch mechanism. A comprehensive retrospective review of medical records was completed of all young people aged 10-18 years presenting to our Central London Emergency Department over a 12-month period. A subset of the total group was identified as the punch injury subgroup. A total of 78 punch injury presentations were identified. In this subgroup, the male: female ratio is 4.57:1; 37.18% of presentations were associated with a fracture (n = 29) and 35.90% (n = 28) of patients re-presented following another punch injury, as a victim of violence, or by other psychiatric presentation. In conclusion, a male preponderance was observed, with frequent re-presentations, often in high-risk circumstances. An opportunity for screening, including mental health, social and substance misuse, was identified. Further research is needed to enable targeted effective interventions in this group.
