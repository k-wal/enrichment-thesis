28282963|a|Studies with magnetoencephalography (MEG) are still quite rarely combined simultaneously with methods that can provide a metabolic dimension to MEG investigation s. In addition, continuous blood pressure measurements which comply with MEG compatibility requirements are lacking. For instance, by combining methods reflecting neurovascular status one could obtain more information on low frequency fluctuations that have recently gained increasing interest as a mediator of functional connectivity within brain networks. This paper presents a multimodal brain imaging setup, capable to non-invasively and continuously measure cerebral hemodynamic, cardiorespiratory and blood pressure oscillations simultaneously with MEG. In the setup, all methods apart from MEG rely on the use of fibre optics. In particular, we present a method for measuring of blood pressure and cardiorespiratory oscillations continuously with MEG. The potential of this type of multimodal setup for brain research is demonstrated by our preliminary studies on human, showing effects of mild hypercapnia, gathered simultaneously with the presented modalities.
