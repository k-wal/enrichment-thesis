27476625|a|To evaluate alcohol / tobacco / illicit drug use and sexual function in adolescent juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and healthy controls. 174 adolescents with pediatric rheumatic diseases were selected. A cross-sectional study with 54 JIA patients and 35 controls included demographic / anthropometric data and puberty markers assessments, physician -conducted CRAFFT (car / relax / alone / forget / friends / trouble) screen tool for substance abuse / dependence high risk and a questionnaire that evaluated sexual function, bullying and alcohol / tobacco / illicit drug use. Clinical / laboratorial data and treatment were also assessed in JIA. The median current age was similar between JIA patients and controls [15(10-19) vs. 15(12-18) years, p=0.506]. Frequencies of alcohol / tobacco / illicit drug use were high and similar in both JIA and controls (43% vs. 46%, p=0.829). However, age at alcohol onset was significantly higher in those with JIA [15(11-18) vs. 14(7-18) years, p=0.032], particularly in polyarticular onset (p=0.040). High risk for substance abuse / dependence (CRAFFT score â‰¥2) was found in both groups (13% vs. 15%, p=1.000), likewise bullying (p=0.088). Further analysis of JIA patients regarding alcohol / tobacco / illicit drug use showed that the median current age [17(14-19) vs. 13(10-19) years, p<0.001] and education years [11(6-13) vs. 7(3-12) years, p<0.001] were significant higher in those that used substances. Sexual activity was significantly higher in the former group (48% vs. 7%, p<0.001). A positive correlation was evidenced between CRAFFT score and current age in JIA patients (p=0.032, r=+0.296). A high risk for substance abuse / dependence was observed in both JIA and controls. JIA substance users were more likely to have sexual intercourse. Therefore, routine screening is suggested in all visits of JIA adolescents.
