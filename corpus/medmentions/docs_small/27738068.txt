27738068|t|Cryoballoon ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation: feasibility and safety of left atrial roof ablation with generation of conduction block in addition to antral pulmonary vein isolation
27738068|a|Although the generation of linear lesions by ablation improves success rates in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), the procedure has been considered unsuitable for cryoablation balloon catheter technologies. We developed a technique for linear ablations, using second-generation cryoballoon technology. This was a single-arm, prospective study in 76 patients with persistent AF treated consecutively at our centre. Cryoablation was performed using a 28 mm second-generation cryoballoon. The first cryoenergy application was performed in close proximity to the position during isolation of the left superior pulmonary vein (PV). Sequential overlapping freezes were applied along the left atrial (LA) roof by slight clockwise rotation of the sheath in combination with slight retraction of the sheath and incremental advancement of the cryoballoon, until reaching the original position for right superior PV isolation. The acute endpoint was the creation of a roofline, defined as complete conduction block across the LA roof >120 ms and ascending activation across the posterior LA wall. Acute success in roofline generation was achieved in 88% of patients, applying on average five (median 4-6) freezes with nadir temperature of -40°C (-36 to -44°C). In five patients, conduction block could not be achieved. No phrenic nerve injuries occurred during roofline generation. Generation of linear roofline lesions is possible with the second-generation cryoballoon. The technique can be used in combination with PV isolation to treat persistent AF with good acute success rates, short procedure times, and acceptable safety concerns. If validated by further studies, the method would be an appealing alternative to radiofrequency ablation techniques.
