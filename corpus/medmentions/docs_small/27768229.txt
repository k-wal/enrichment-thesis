27768229|a|Correlation of increased copeptin levels with various cardiovascular diseases has been described. The clinical use of copeptin levels in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has not been investigated before. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic value of copeptin levels in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM was defined as presence of left ventricular wall thickness â‰¥15 mm in a subject without any concomitant disease that may cause left ventricular hypertrophy. Levels of copeptin and plasma N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were evaluated prospectively in 24 obstructive HCM patients, 36 nonobstructive HCM patients, and 36 age - and sex - matched control subjects. Blood samples were collected in the morning between 7 and 9 am after overnight fasting. Patients were followed for 24 months. Hospitalization with diagnosis of heart failure / arrhythmia, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation, and cardiac mortality were accepted as adverse cardiac events. Copeptin and NT-proBNP levels were higher in the HCM group compared with controls (14.1 vs 8.4 pmol/L, P < 0.01; and 383 vs 44 pg/mL, P < 0.01, respectively). Copeptin and NT-proBNP levels were higher in the obstructive HCM subgroup compared with the nonobstructive HCM subgroup (18.3 vs 13.1 pmol/L, P < 0.01; and 717 vs 223 pg/mL, P < 0.01, respectively). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, copeptin and NT-proBNP levels remained as independent predictors of heart failure (P < 0.01 for both) and adverse cardiac events (P < 0.01 for both). Copeptin and NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in patients with obstructive HCM, and higher levels were associated with worse outcome.
