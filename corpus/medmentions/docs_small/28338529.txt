28338529|a|The aim of this work is to validate a software package called Hermes Internal Radiation Dosimetry (HIRD) for internal dose assessment tailored for clinical practice. The software includes all the necessary steps to perform voxel -level absorbed dose calculations including quantitative reconstruction, image coregistration and volume of interest tools. The basics of voxel -level dosimetry methods and implementations to HIRD software are reviewed. Then, HIRD is validated using simulated SPECT / CT data and data from Lu-DOTATATE - treated patients by comparing absorbed kidney doses with OLINDA/EXM -based dosimetry. In addition, electron and photon dose components are studied separately in an example patient case. The simulation study showed that HIRD can reproduce time-activity curves accurately and produce absorbed doses with less than 10% error for the kidneys, liver and spleen. From the patient data, the absorbed kidney doses calculated using HIRD and using OLINDA/EXM were highly correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r=0.98). From Bland-Altman plot analysis, an average absorbed dose difference of -2% was found between the methods. In addition, we found that in Lu-DOTATATE - treated patients, photons can contribute over 10% of the kidney's total dose and is partly because of cross-irradiation from high - uptake lesions close to the kidneys. HIRD is a straightforward voxel -level internal dosimetry software. Its clinical utility was verified with simulated and clinical Lu-DOTATATE - treated patient data. Patient studies also showed that photon contribution towards the total dose can be relatively high and voxel -level dose calculations can be valuable in cases where the target organ is in close proximity to high- uptake organs.
