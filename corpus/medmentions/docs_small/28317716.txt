28317716|t|A nano-delivery system for bioactive ingredients using supercritical carbon dioxide and its release behaviors
28317716|a|For the purpose of ensuring the bioavailability of bioactive ingredients, a nano-delivery system with low toxicity was developed using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC - CO2). Compared to thin-film hydration (TFH), obtaining nano-scale liposomes is easier using SC - CO2. The characteristic of these liposomes was also demonstrated by the analysis of particle size and morphology. An in vitro release study showed that liposomes produced using SC - CO2 were resistant to low pH in simulated gastric conditions. In a simulated intestinal environment, enteric solubility of these liposomes was enhanced, which are important properties for controlled releasing bioactive ingredient. Furthermore, SC - CO2 -produced liposomes had a higher storage stability than those produced using TFH. Analysis of the organic solvent residue in the liposomes by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicated that SC - CO2 -produced liposomes had lower toxicity than those produced by TFH. A chemical free nano-delivery system using SC - CO2 has been revealed for storage and controlled release of bioactive ingredients.
