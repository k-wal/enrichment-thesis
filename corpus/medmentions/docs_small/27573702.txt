27573702|a|Cerebral toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of space occupying brain lesion in patients with HIV/AIDS in Brazil. In the post-HAART era, it is responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study consists of a case series of 56 patients diagnosed with cerebral toxoplasmosis whose clinical features, brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid aspects were analyzed. Cerebral toxoplasmosis led to the diagnosis of infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 27 (48.2%) of the patients, while 29 (51.2%) others already knew to be HIV seropositive. However, at the time of diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis, only 9 (16.6%) reported being under antiretroviral therapy and 5 (8.9%) were receiving primary prophylaxis for toxoplasmosis. Headache, strength deficit and fever were the most frequent signs and symptoms throughout the study. Fifty-three patients showed changes consistent with toxoplasmosis in CT or MRI. Thirty-four (60.7%) CSF samples were positive in the indirect haemagglutination test and for the reaction of Toxoplasma gondii IgG ELISA, while 31 (55.4%) were positive in the direct haemagglutination test. Fifty (89.3%) patients underwent first-line treatment for toxoplasmosis. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is still a very relevant neurological disease in individuals with AIDS admitted to neurology emergency departments. Early diagnosis and initiation of empiric treatment and antiretroviral therapy are important for good prognosis.
