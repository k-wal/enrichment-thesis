28459391|a|We investigated the impact of Nordic Walking (NW) on gait patterns in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) following a 6-week NW familiarization. Twelve participants with PD and healthy older adults took part in a gait analysis walking with and without poles (NP). Results showed larger knee power (knee extensor: K2) on the most affected leg in NW compared to NP (P=0.01). On the less affected side, larger power absorption (knee extensor: K3) was found during pre - swing (K3) compared to older adults in both NP and NW (P=0.01). NW showed longer stride length and single support time (P<0.01) compared to NP. Walking with poles improved gait spatial - temporal characteristics and power profile s at the knee joint both on the less and most affected sides in individuals with PD. NW could be beneficial to help regain a more functional gait pattern in PD.
