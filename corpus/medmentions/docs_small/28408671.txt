28408671|t|Complete Genome Sequences of Chikungunya Viruses Isolated from Plasma Specimens Collected from Haitians in 2014
28408671|a|Ten chikungunya virus isolates from human plasma collected in Haiti from May to August 2014, in the midst of a chikungunya fever outbreak, were fully sequenced. The resulting genomic sequences are nearly identical, and phylogenetic analyses indicate they belong to the Asian lineage of the virus.
