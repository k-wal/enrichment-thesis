28504776|t|Insulin -mediated hypoglycaemia secondary to recurrent clear cell renal carcinoma
28504776|a|Renal cell carcinoma has previously been associated with hypoglycaemia in the setting of non-islet cell tumours, caused by a paraneoplastic phenomenon relating to the production of insulin-like growth factor type II. We present a case of recurrent clear cell renal cell carcinoma, leading to an insulin -mediated paraneoplastic phenomenon causing severe recurrent hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemina was managed successfully using diazoxide therapy, in conjunction with pazopanib and radiotherapy to reduce tumour burden.
