27328333|a|The review provides updates on novel risk markers for the development of pediatric inflammatory uveitis and a severe disease course, on treatment of refractory disease, and on the measurement of visual outcomes. There are several new genetic markers, biomarkers, and clinical factors that may influence a child's uveitis disease course. It is important to identify children at risk for poor visual outcomes and who are refractory to traditional therapy. Racial disparities have recently been reported. We describe agents of potential benefit. In addition, we discuss the importance of patient reported outcomes in this population. Uveitis can lead to vision-threatening complications. Timely and aggressive treatment of children identified to be at risk for a severe uveitis course may lead to improved outcomes.
