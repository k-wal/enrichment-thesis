27436784|t|Epigenotype, genotype, and phenotype analysis of patients in Taiwan with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome
27436784|a|Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a congenital overgrowth disorder predisposing to tumorigenesis that results from abnormal expression or function of imprinted genes of chromosome 11p15.5. Forty-seven patients in Taiwan with clinical suspicion of BWS were referred for diagnostic testing based on methylation profiling of H19 -associated imprinting center (IC) 1 and KCNQ1OT1 -associated IC2 using high-resolution melting analysis, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, or high-resolution quantitative methylation profiling. Twenty-eight patients received a clinical diagnosis of BWS (the presence of 3 major features or 2 major features and at least 1 minor feature), 18 had suspected BWS (the presence of at least 1 major feature), and 1 had isolated Wilms' tumor. Nineteen patients were identified with IC2 hypomethylation (including 1 with isolated Wilms' tumor), 1 with IC1 hypermethylation, 2 with paternal uniparental disomy, and 1 with CDKN1C mutation. Several clinical features were found to be statistically different (P<0.05) between the 2 groups- clinical diagnosis of BWS (n=28) or suspected BWS (n=18)-including macroglossia, pre- or postnatal gigantism, abdominal wall defect, ear creases, facial nevus flammeus, BWS score, and the molecular diagnosis rate. Molecular lesion was detected in 81% of patients with the presence of three major features, compared with 33% and 28% of those with two or one major feature, respectively. The mean BWS score was 5.6 for 19 subjects with "IC2 hypomethylation ", compared with 3.8 for 2 subjects with pUPD. The BWS score of one subject with CDKN1C mutation and one with IC1 hypermethylation was 6 and 7, respectively. The BWS score was positively correlated with the molecular diagnosis rate (P<0.01). The BWS database of epigenotype, genotype, and phenotype is expected to promote better genetic counseling and medical care of these patients.
