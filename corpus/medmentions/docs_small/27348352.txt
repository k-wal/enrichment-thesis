27348352|t|Contemporary mandibular reconstruction
27348352|a|Multiple disease processes, including neoplasia, trauma, and medication side-effects, necessitate segmental resection and subsequent reconstruction of the mandible. As surgical techniques have advanced, several technologies have been developed with the potential to significantly transform a surgeon's approach to the restoration of mandibular continuity. The purpose of this review is to highlight many of these relatively newer tools and discuss their evolving role in mandibular reconstruction. Several contemporary studies have documented the application of different approaches and modifications to mandibular reconstruction - including computer-aided design or computer-aided modeling, contemporary plating systems, osseointegrated implants, and various modifications to existing osseocutaneous free tissue transfer options - and have reported relatively high success rates. In discussing these reports, we present a survey of current and developing technologies in the field of mandibular reconstruction and aim to provide sufficient context for the gradual integration of these techniques into practice.
