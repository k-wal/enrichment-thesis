27882558|a|Individuals with idiopathic subglottic stenosis (SGS) are at risk for voice disorders prior to and following surgical management. This study examined the nature and severity of voice disorders in patients with SGS before and after a revised cricotracheal resection (CTR) procedure designed to minimize adverse effects on voice function. Eleven women with idiopathic SGS provided presurgical and postsurgical audio recordings. Voice Handicap Index (VHI) scores were also collected. Cepstral, signal-to-noise, periodicity, and fundamental frequency (F0) analyses were undertaken for connected speech and sustained vowel samples. Listeners made auditory - perceptual ratings of overall quality and monotonicity. Paired samples statistical analyses revealed that mean F0 decreased from 215 Hz (standard deviation [SD] = 40 Hz) to 201 Hz (SD = 65 Hz) following surgery. In general, VHI scores decreased after surgery. Voice disorder severity based on the Cepstral Spectral Index of Dysphonia (KayPentax, Montvale, NJ) for sustained vowels decreased (improved) from 41 (SD = 41) to 25 (SD = 21) points; no change was observed for connected speech. Semitone SD (2.2 semitones) did not change from pre- to posttreatment. Auditory - perceptual ratings demonstrated similar results. These preliminary results indicate that this revised CTR procedure is promising in minimizing adverse voice effects while offering a longer-term surgical outcome for SGS. Further research is needed to determine causal factors for pretreatment voice disorders, as well as to optimize treatments in this population. 4. Laryngoscope, 2016.
