27243664|a|Immunoafﬁnity columns (IACs) are a well-established tool in the determination of regulated mycotoxins in food and feed commodities. However, they also have the potential to become attractive pre-concentration and clean-up materials for the determination of masked (also called modified) mycotoxins, which have been recognised as important contributors to the toxicological hazard deriving from fungal spoilage of goods. However, the information available in the literature concerning the cross-reactivity of DON - IACs against the major conjugates (DON-3-G, 15-AcDON and 3-AcDON) is incomplete and often contradictory. We have carried out a detailed characterisation of the cross-reactivity of the four main IACs brands against DON and its conjugates as well as an assessment of the competition among the analytes. Only one IAC enabled the simultaneous analysis of all relevant DON forms while two missed 15-AcDON and the fourth one missed DON-3-G and 3-AcDON. In the case of the multivalent IAC, the analytes modified at the C-3 position compete for the antibody binding with preference for 3-AcDON (less spatially hindered) while DON-3-G has the more-hindered access to the active sites. Taking into consideration the levels of DON conjugates existing in real samples, the cross-reactivity of one DON - IAC allows a quantitative analysis of all of these analytes. Important but rather neglected aspects such as the continuous supply of IACs with identical characteristics, and of columns which are strictly blank, are also addressed in this paper.
