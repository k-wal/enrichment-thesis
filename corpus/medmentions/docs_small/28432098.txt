28432098|a|Coumarins are widely found in plants as natural constituents having antimicrobial activity. When considering plants rich in coumarins for biogas production, adverse effects on microorganisms driving the anaerobic digestion process are expected. Furthermore, coumarin derivatives like warfarin, which are used as anti-coagulating medicine, are found in wastewater affecting its treatment. Coumarin as the structure common to all coumarins inhibits the anaerobic digestion process. However, details of this inhibition are still elusive. Here, we studied the impact of coumarin on acetogenesis and methanogenesis. First, coumarin was applied at four concentrations between 0.25 and 1 g L(-1) to pure cultures of the methanogens Methanosarcina barkeri and Methanospirillum hungatei leading to up to 25% less methane production. Acetate production of syntrophic propionate and butyrate degrading cultures of Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans and Syntrophomonas wolfei were inhibited by 72% at a coumarin concentration of 1 g L(-1) Coumarin also inhibited acetogenesis and acetoclastic methanogenesis in a complex biogas reactor microbiome. When a coumarin-adapted microbiome was used, acetogenesis and methanogenesis were not inhibited. According to amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and mcrA genes, the microbial communities of both microbiomes were similar though Methanoculleus was more and Methanobacterium was less abundant in the coumarin-adapted than in the non-adapted microbiome. Our results suggest that well-dosed feeding with coumarin -rich feedstocks to full-scale biogas reactors keeping the coumarin concentrations below 0.5 g L(-1) will allow adaptation to coumarins by structural and functional community reorganization and coumarin degradation .IMPORTANCE Coumarins from natural and anthropogenic sources have an inhibitory impact on the anaerobic digestion process. Here, we studied in detail the adverse effects of the model compound coumarin on acetogenesis and methanogenesis, which are two important steps of the anaerobic digestion process. Coumarin concentrations lower than 0.5 g L(-1) had only a minor impact. Even though similar inhibitory effects can be assumed for coumarin derivatives, little effects on the anaerobic treatment of wastewater are expected where concentrations of coumarin derivatives are lower than 0.5 g L(-1) However, when full scale reactors are fed with coumarin -rich feedstocks, the biogas processes might be inhibited. Hence, these feedstocks should be utilized in a well- dosed manner or after adaptation of the microbial community.
