28383311|t|Musculoskeletal pain profile of obese individuals attending a multidisciplinary weight management service
28383311|a|Obesity is associated with numerous chronic diseases, including musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, which impacts on quality of life (QoL). There is, however, limited research providing a comprehensive MSK pain profile of an obese cohort. This retrospective study utilized a patient database at a national weight management service (WMS). Following ethical approval, anonymized patient data were statistically analyzed to develop a pain profile, investigate relationships between pain, sleep, and function, and explore variables associated with having low back pain (LBP) and knee pain. Overall, 915 individuals attended the WMS from January 2011 to September 2015 [male, 35% (n=318; CI =32-38); female, 65% (n=597; CI =62-68); mean age 44.6]. Mean BMI was 50.7 kg/m2 [Class III obese (BMI â‰¥40 kg/m2), 92% (n=835; CI =91-94)]. Approximately 91% reported MSK pain: LBP, 69% (n=539; CI =65- 72) [mean NRS 7.4]; knee pain, 58% (n=447; CI =55-61) [mean NRS 6.8]. Class III obese and multi-site pain patients had lower QoL and physical activity levels, reduced sleep, and poorer physical function than less obese patients and those without pain (p<0.05). Relationships were found between demographic, pain, self-report, psychological, and functional measures (p<0.05). Patients who slept fewer hours and had poorer functional outcomes were more likely to have LBP; patients who were divorced, had lower QoL, and more frequent nocturia were more likely to have knee pain (p<0.05). Multi-site MSK pain is prevalent and severe in obese patients and is negatively associated with most self-report and functional outcomes. This high prevalence suggests pain management strategies must be considered when treating obesity.
