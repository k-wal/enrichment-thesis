27454401|t|Fabrication and modelling of fractal, biomimetic, micro and nano-topographical surfaces
27454401|a|Natural surface topographies are often self-similar with hierarchical features at the micro and nanoscale, which may be mimicked to overcome modern tissue engineering and biomaterial design limitations. Specifically, a cell's microenvironment within the human body contains highly optimised, fractal topographical cues, which directs precise cell behaviour. However, recreating biomimetic, fractal topographies in vitro is not a trivial process and a number of fabrication methods have been proposed but often fail to precisely control the spatial resolution of features at different lengths scales and hence, to provide true biomimetic properties. Here, we propose a method of accurately reproducing the self-similar, micro and nanoscale topography of a human biological tissue into a synthetic polymer through an innovative fabrication process. The biological tissue surface was characterised using atomic force microscopy (AFM) to obtain spatial data in X, Y and Z, which was converted into a grayscale 'digital photomask'. As a result of maskless grayscale optical lithography followed by modified deep reactive ion etching and replica molding, we were able to accurately reproduce the fractal topography of acellular dermal matrix (ADM) into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Characterisation using AFM at three different length scales revealed that the nano and micro-topographical features, in addition to the fractal dimension, of native ADM were reproduced in PDMS. In conclusion, it has been shown that the fractal topography of biological surfaces can be mimicked in synthetic materials using the novel fabrication process outlined, which may be applied to significantly enhance medical device biocompatibility and performance.
