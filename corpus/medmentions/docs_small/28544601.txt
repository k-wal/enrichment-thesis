28544601|t|The impact of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features on the performance of the Afirma gene expression classifier
28544601|a|A recent revision in thyroid tumor nomenclature has resulted in a change from a malignant diagnosis (noninvasive follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma) to one that is nonmalignant (noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features [NIFTP]). The objective of the current study was to evaluate the impact of this change on the performance of the Afirma gene expression classifier (GEC). The authors retrospectively analyzed consecutive thyroid fine-needle aspiration specimens with indeterminate diagnoses on which GEC was performed. Surgical pathology material was reviewed with the reclassification of nodules into NIFTP. GEC testing was performed on 384 fine-needle aspiration specimens diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) (304 cases) and suspicious for a follicular neoplasm (SFN) (80 cases) and yielded a suspicious result in 152 of the AUS cases (50%) and 50 of the SFN cases (63%). Thyroidectomy was performed on 177 patients. After reclassifying NIFTP, the positive predictive value of GEC decreased from 42% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 39%-45%) to 24% (95% CI, 22%-26%) in the AUS group and from 23% (95% CI, 19%-27%) to 13% (95% CI, 9%-18%) in the SFN group. Total thyroidectomy was performed more frequently than a partial thyroidectomy in patients with AUS with a suspicious GEC result compared with pre-GEC controls (68% vs 49%; P = .037). Reclassification of NIFTP significantly decreases the positive predictive value of GEC in indeterminate thyroid nodules. Nevertheless, the majority of patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules with a suspicious GEC result in the study institution have undergone total thyroidectomy. This finding raises concerns over reliance on a suspicious GEC result by clinicians to justify total thyroidectomy. Cancer Cytopathol 2017. Â© 2017 American Cancer Society.
