27882444|t|Genomic characterization of a wild-bird - origin pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) first isolated in the northwest region of China
27882444|a|Pigeon paramyxovirus type-1 (PPMV-1) is an enzootic in pigeon flocks and causes severe economic losses in the poultry industry in many countries. A PPMV-1 isolate, abbreviated as PPMV-1/QL-01/CH/15, was isolated from a great spotted woodpecker in the northwest region of China in 2015. The complete genome was sequenced, and the results showed that the virus genome was 15,192 nt in length, in the gene arrangement 3'-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5'. Several amino acid mutations were identified in the functional domains of the F and HN proteins. The pathogenicity index of the isolate was evaluated, and the mean death time (MDT) was 72 h and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) was 0.925, indicating that this isolate was mesogenic. Sequencing results showed that it had a virulent Newcastle disease virus cleavage motif (112)R-R-Q-K-R-F(117) at the fusion protein cleavage site. Morbidity and mortality were 70% and 50%, after inoculation of pigeons, whereas this virus was nonpathogenic in chickens. Different immune responses of pigeons and chickens were induced in vivo, which led to different HI serum antibody titers. The results of phylogenetic and evolutionary distance analysis showed that this PPMV-1 strain belonged to sub-genotype VIa in class II. To our knowledge, this is the first identification and analysis of PPMV-1 co-circulation among wild birds and domestic pigeon flocks in China. The data from this study highlight the important role of wild birds in the dissemination of PPMV-1 and provide useful references for improving our understanding of the distribution and evolution of PPMV-1 in China.
