28409856|a|Asbestos was used in dentistry as a binder in periodontal dressings and as lining material for casting rings and crucible. However, until now, only one case of malignant mesothelioma with occupational exposure to asbestos in dental practice has been reported. We present 4 pleural mesotheliomas out of 5344 cases identified in Lombardy, Italy, in 2000-2014. Three men had been working as dental laboratory technicians, with asbestos exposure for 10, 34, and 4 years, and one woman had been helping her husband for 30 years in manufacturing dental prostheses. The men described the use of asbestos as a lining material for casting rings, while the woman was not able to confirm this use. We confirm the association of malignant mesothelioma with dental technician work. Dental technicians suffering from mesothelioma should be questioned about past occupational asbestos exposure.
