28296818|t|Endoscopic Stricturotomy with Needle Knife in the Treatment of Strictures from Inflammatory Bowel Disease
28296818|a|Fibrotic strictures in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are often not amenable to medical therapy. Therapy with endoscopic balloon dilation usually requires frequent repeat treatments. Therefore, we developed the novel needle knife stricturotomy (NKSt) for the treatment of strictures in the patients with IBD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NKSt. Data of patients with strictures treated with NKSt in our Interventional IBD Unit at the Cleveland Clinic were extracted from the registry. The primary and secondary outcomes were surgery-free survival and procedure-related complications. A total of 85 patients were included in this study. Multiple strictures were noticed in 30 (35.3%) patients at inception, giving a total of 127 strictures treated. The median length of the treated strictures was 1.5 cm (interquartile range: 1.0-2.0) and 52 (41.6%) were endoscopically nontraversable. The immediate success with passage of the scope through the stricture after NKSt therapy was achieved in all patients. During the median follow-up of 0.9 years (interquartile range: 0.3-1.8) and a median of 2.0 treatment (interquartile range: 1.0-3.0), 13 (15.3%) patients required stricture-related surgery. There were 77 (60.6%) patients who required additional NKSt, endoscopic balloon dilation, or both after the inception of NKSt. In a total of 272 NKSt procedures performed, 10 (3.7%) adverse events occurred, including 9 with delayed bleeding and one hospitalization due to perforation. Endoscopic NKSt is effective and safe for treating the primary and secondary IBD -related strictures, which may provide an alternative for endoscopic balloon dilation and surgical intervention.
