27690568|t|A single session of exhaustive exercise markedly decreases circulating levels of guanidinoacetic acid in healthy men and women
27690568|a|We evaluated the effects of exercise on circulating concentrations of guanidinoacetic acid (GAA) and creatine in 23 healthy volunteers subjected to running to exhaustion and free-weight bench-press to volitional failure. Blood was taken before and following each exercise session. Running induced a significant decrease in serum GAA by 20.1% (P < 0.001), while free-weight exercise reduced GAA by 11.7% (P < 0.001), suggesting the possible use of serum GAA as a novel biomarker of exhaustion.
