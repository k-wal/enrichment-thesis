28134011|t|Noteworthy Literature Published in 2016 for Thoracic Surgery
28134011|a|The past year has produced several important articles in the field of thoracic surgery, spanning many different diseases. Thoracic surgeons continue to investigate methods to perform complex operations and procedures less invasively, with the least possible morbidity to our patients. We also continue to critically evaluate new technology and procedures to ensure that they meet our rigorous standards for oncologic efficacy and for management of benign disease. Importantly, as we continue to evolve, thoracic surgeons have remained focused on optimizing processes of care, both inside and outside the operating room. The purpose of this review is to highlight the major advances in thoracic surgical disease in the year 2016.
