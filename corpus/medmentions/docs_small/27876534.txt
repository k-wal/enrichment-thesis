27876534|a|Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is considered a valid experimental model for multiple sclerosis, a chronic neuroinflammatory condition of the central nervous system. Additionally, some evidence has shown that some microbial products such as the bacterial lipopolysaccharide could lead to the activation of reactive immune cells, triggering neuroinflammation. Several studies have found that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may exert a neuroprotective effect. Therefore, we aimed to assess the effect of TMS on the neuroinflammation occurring in EAE. A total of 44 male Dark Agouti rats were used. EAE induction was performed administering subcutaneously at the dorsal base of the tail a single dose of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. Clinical evaluation of motor symptoms was performed. Brain and spinal cord were collected and analyzed for nitric oxide, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein. We also carried out a histologic exam, which included an astrocyte immunostaining and Nissl staining for the assessment of brain cell density and pyknotic nuclei. TMS effectively ameliorated motor impairment secondary to EAE. This form of magnetic field was capable of decreasing the proliferation of astrocytes as a response to the autoimmune attack, reducing the content of nitric oxide, bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein in central nervous system. Moreover, in treated animals, brain cell density was improved and the number of pyknotic nuclei was decreased. Transcranial magnetic stimulation modifies astrocytosis, cell density and lipopolysaccharide levels in EAE. These results suggest that TMS could be a promising treatment for neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis.
