28281271|t|Development of Dual Quantitative Lateral Flow Immunoassay for the Detection of Mycotoxins
28281271|a|Lateral flow immunoassays have been widely used in recent years for detection of toxins, heavy metals, and biomarkers. To improve the efficiency of individual lateral flow immunoassays, multiplex analytical strips play an important role in the detection of several important analytes. In this chapter, development of a dual lateral flow immunoassay is presented for detection of a variety of low molecular weight molecules. Various buffers, additives, and materials are introduced and evaluated. Depending on the analyte to be tested, the technique allows for selection of optimum buffers, additives, and other materials.
