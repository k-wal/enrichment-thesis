27665545|t|Twisting method for reducing friction during insertion of a sheath introducer and a sheathless guiding catheter
27665545|a|A sheathless system that inserts a catheter directly into the artery can reduce puncture site -related complications through a 2-Fr reduction of the outer diameter. However, the gap between the dilator and the guiding catheter of the sheathless system is larger than the gap between the dilator and sheath of the introducer system, resulting in stronger insertion resistance. A twisting method with rapid alternating rotation of a device to the left and right during insertion can reduce the insertion resistance. This method can be effective with the sheathless system which has a larger gap. To examine the effect of size reduction on the sheathless system and the effect of insertion resistance reduction using the twisting method, we developed an insertion simulator and compared insertion resistance to a 5-Fr sheath introducer and a 5-Fr sheathless system, with and without the twisting method. The insertion simulator pushed a sheath introducer or a sheathless system toward a mock artery consisted with a 5-mm urethane and a 1-mm rubber sheet by an electrical motor with or without twisting motion generated by a crank shaft. Insertion resistance during the penetration was measured by a tension meter. The insertion resistance was less with the 5-Fr sheathless system than with the 5-Fr sheath introducer. The resistance reduced further with use of twisting for both the sheathed and sheathless catheters. In conclusion, the experiment suggests the benefits of twisting insertion of a sheathless guiding catheter for reduction of puncture site -related complications.
