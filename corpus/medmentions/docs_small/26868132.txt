26868132|t|Association of RBP4 levels with increased arterial stiffness in adolescents with family history of type 2 diabetes
26868132|a|The aim of this study was to explore the impact of family history of type 2 diabetes (FH2D) on arterial stiffness in young people and its relationship to adipocytokines. This case-control study included 52 adolescents (male / female 28/24) with FH2D (FH2D+) and 40 adolescents (male / female 21/19) without FH2D (FH2D-). Anthropometric measurements, including height, weight, waist circumference (WC), and blood pressure, were obtained. Blood samples were collected, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), serum lipids, Retinol Binding Protein 4 (RBP4), C reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin and visfatin were examined. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was used to evaluate arterial stiffness. Visceral fat area (VFA) was measured by computerized tomography. Compared with FH2D- group, FH2D+ group had a significantly higher oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 2-hour insulin, RBP4 and baPWV levels, a lower adiponectin and glucose infusing rate (GIR) (P<0.05). BaPWV was positively correlated with age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 2-hour (OGTT) insulin, RBP4, and VFA, and negatively correlated with GIR in FH2D+ group. After multivariate analysis, age, SBP, RBP4 and VFA maintained an independent association with baPWV in FH2D+ group (P<0.05), while only age, SBP, and VFA were independent predictors of baPWV in FH2D- group (P<0.05). These findings led to the conclusion that RBP4 level was associated with increased arterial stiffness in young subjects with family history of type 2 diabetes.
