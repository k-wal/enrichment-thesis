28422945|t|Growth pattern and final height of very preterm versus very low birth weight infants
28422945|a|Both very preterm (VP; i.e., gestational age <32 weeks) and very low birth weight (VLBW; i.e., birth weight <1,500 grams) are used as inclusion criteria by studies on preterm birth. We aimed to quantify the impact of these entities on postnatal growth until final height. Subjects born VP and/or with VLBW from the Project On Preterm and Small-for-gestational-age infants cohort were classified as: (1) VP+/VLBW+ (n=495), (2) VP+/VLBW- (n=207) or (3) VP-/VLBW + (n=296) infants. Anthropometric data were collected at birth, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months corrected age, and at 5 and 19 years. At 19 years, 590/998 (59%) of the subjects enrolled in 1983 were followed up. Birth size was smallest in the VP-/VLBW+ group compared to the VP+/VLBW+ and VP+/VLBW- groups. During childhood, length, weight and head circumference SD - scores increased in the VP-VLBW+ group, while SD - scores in the VP+/VLBW+ and VP+/VLBW- groups remained stable or decreased. Despite catch-up growth, VP-/VLBW+ infants remained the shortest and lightest at age 19. Classification according to VP and VLBW impacts growth, causing different growth patterns for infants born VP+/VLBW+, VP+/VLBW- or VP-/VLBW+. For future studies we recommend, at least for industrialized countries, including preterm infants based on gestational age .Pediatric Research accepted article preview online, 19 April 2017. doi:10.1038/pr.2017.63.
