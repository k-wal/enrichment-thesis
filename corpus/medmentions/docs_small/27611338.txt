27611338|t|Influence of Sinus Floor Configuration on the Grafted Bone Remodeling Following Osteotome Sinus Floor Elevation
27611338|a|This study investigated the influence of the sinus floor configuration on the dimensional stability of grafted bone height following the osteotome sinus grafting procedure. Forty single tooth dental implants inserted following the placement of bioglass and/or allograft into the sinus area using an osteotome technique in 37 patients were evaluated in this retrospective study. Periapical radiographs were taken using the long-cone technique before and after implant placement. Specifically, radiographic measurements of grafted bone height at the mesial and distal side of each implant were taken, and the sinus floor configuration was classified into concave, angle, and flat according to the sinus floor profile at the implant site. Further, the intruding angle, which was defined as the angle between the implant axis and the sinus floor, was measured. All of the implants were clinically stable during a mean follow-up period of 39.2 months. The mean initial gain of the sinus grafted bone height was 7.0 ± 1.9 mm, and it later reduced to 4.6 ± 1.9 mm after follow-up (p < 0.001). A greater reduction in grafted bone height was revealed in the flat sinus group compared to the concave group (p < 0.001). The results from the linear regression showed that larger intruding angles were statistically significantly associated with a greater reduction in grafted bone height (r(2) = 0.55, p < 0.001). All bioglass and/or allograft placed in the maxillary sinus following the osteotome technique underwent remodeling and shrinkage, while the outcome of the procedure was more predictable in sinuses with a concave floor and small implant intruding angles.
