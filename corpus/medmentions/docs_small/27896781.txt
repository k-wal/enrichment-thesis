27896781|t|Multiplex Biomarker Approaches to Enable Point-of-Care Testing and Personalized Medicine
27896781|a|This chapter describes how current and future innovations driven by application of multiplex biomarker techniques can help in earlier and more efficacious treatment of patients, suffering from the world's most devastating and costly diseases. The application of new miniaturized biosensors and transducers will enable point-of-care testing by facilitating analysis of a single drop of a blood within the time span of a visit to the doctor's office. It is anticipated that the scoring algorithms used with future tests will incorporate both biochemical and clinical data, resulting in specific profiles for each patient or tested subject to enable personalized medicine approaches.
