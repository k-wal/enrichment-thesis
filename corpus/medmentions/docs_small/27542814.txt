27542814|t|A Comparison Between Measured Concentration of 3H in Kalpakkam Environment with Predicted Atmospheric Dispersion Model
27542814|a|The field measurements of 3H in the form of HTO present in air moisture carried out around Madras Atomic Power Station were compared with predicted values using atmospheric dispersion modeling. Air 3H samples were collected from different sectors at the site boundary of the operating reactors for the period of 2 y and compared with Gaussian Plume model. The predictions were comparable with the measured value. The slight variation observed between the two methods is attributed to the uncertainty involved in the measurement of air 3H concentration and in the measurement of site-specific meteorological parameters. The radiation dose imparted to members of public due to the levels observed is well within station technical specification limit for 3H.
