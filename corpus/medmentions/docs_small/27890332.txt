27890332|a|Examine effects of hospital transfer into a quaternary care center on surgical outcomes of intestinal atresia. Children <1 yo principally diagnosed with intestinal atresia were identified using the Kids' Inpatient Database (2012). Exposure variable was patient transfer status. Outcomes measured were inpatient mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS) and discharge status. Linearized standard errors, design-based F tests, and multivariable logistic regression were performed. 1672 weighted discharges represented a national cohort. The highest income group and those with private insurance had significantly lower odds of transfer (OR:0.53 and 0.74, p < 0.05). Rural patients had significantly higher transfer rates (OR: 2.73, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed no difference in mortality (OR:0.71, p = 0.464) or non-home discharge (OR: 0.79, p = 0.166), but showed prolonged LOS (OR:1.79, p < 0.05) amongst transferred patients. Significant differences in hospital LOS and treatment access reveal a potential healthcare gap. Post-acute care resources should be improved for transferred patients.
