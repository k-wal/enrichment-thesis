27742121|t|The association between antidepressant use and hemoglobin A1C in older adults
27742121|a|Depression is known to increase diabetes risk and worsen glycemic control in older adults, who already experience high rates of diabetes. The independent impact of antidepressants on glucose control is less clear. Data was drawn from the Health and Retirement Study, a large nationally - representative longitudinal study of retired individuals. Crude and adjusted linear models stratified by diabetes status were used to examine the cross-sectional associations between antidepressant use categorized by subclass and continuous hemoglobin A1C. The sample included 1,153 individuals, most over the age of 70. Antidepressant use was not associated with hemoglobin A1C in any model whether stratified or in the total combined sample. Antidepressants as a class were also not associated with hemoglobin A1C. These findings add to the literature suggesting that antidepressants are not associated with diabetes risk or glycemic control. Prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm this finding.
