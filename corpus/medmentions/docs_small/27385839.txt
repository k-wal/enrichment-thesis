27385839|t|Subluxation and semantics: a corpus linguistics study
27385839|a|The purpose of this study was to analyze the curriculum of one chiropractic college in order to discover if there were any implicit consensus definitions of the term subluxation. Using the software WordSmith Tools, the corpus of an undergraduate chiropractic curriculum was analyzed by reviewing collocated terms and through discourse analysis of text blocks containing words based on the root ' sublux .' It was possible to identify 3 distinct concepts which were each referred to as ' subluxation :' i) an acute or instantaneous injurious event; ii) a clinical syndrome which manifested post - injury; iii) a physical lesion, i.e. an anatomical or physiological derangement which in most instances acted as a pain generator. In fact, coherent implicit definitions of subluxation exist and may enjoy broad but subconscious acceptance. However, confusion likely arises from failure to distinguish which concept an author or speaker is referring to when they employ the term subluxation.
