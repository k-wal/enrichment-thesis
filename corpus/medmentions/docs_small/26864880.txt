26864880|t|Combining electrostatic powder with an insecticide: effect on stored - product beetles and on the commodity
26864880|a|The opportunity to reduce the amount of pirimiphos-methyl applied to grain by formulating it in an electrostatic powder was investigated. The insecticidal efficacy of pirimiphos-methyl in EC formulation or formulated using electrostatic powder (EP) as an inert carrier was investigated against Sitophilus oryzae (L.), Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) and Tribolium confusum Jacquelin du Val. Furthermore, the adhesive properties of EP to rice, corn and wheat, together with the effect on bulk density and bread - and pasta - making properties, were investigated. The results showed that pirimiphos-methyl formulated with EP provided better efficacy against adults when compared with EC formulation for O. surinamensis and T. confusum, but there was no difference for R. dominica. Progeny production was consistently lower in grain treated with the EP formulation than in grain treated with the EC. Tests showed that EP adhered to the kernels for longer on hard wheat than on maize or rice. In most commodities, EP did not alter the bulk density. Finally, the addition of EP did not affect flour - and bread - making properties, nor the pasta -making properties. The results of the present study suggest that an EP could be used to reduce the amount of pirimiphos-methyl applied to grain for effective pest control, with no detrimental effects on grain quality.
