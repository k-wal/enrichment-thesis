27994293|t|Expression IRF / MUM1 >25% Predictor to Three- year Survival of Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma in the Immunochemotherapy Era
27994293|a|Non Hodgkin lymphoma - Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBC) is composed of more varieties of one disease. Analysis and understanding of a wide range of characteristics of the disease, which include: clinical, immunohistochemical, cytogenetic and molecular characteristics may improve treatment results. achieving the estimated three- year survival and influence of IRF / MUM1 expression to three- year survival. A study was retrospective-prospective, patients were followed for seven years a period of dine. The study included 60 patients de novo DLBCL. Age was 18-72 years old, the average age 45 years, male 31 (51,7%) and female 29 (48.3%). Median follow-up was 47 months (3-91 months). To determine differentiation immunophenotype antibodies those were used anti-CD20, anti-CD10, anti-Bcl-6, IRF-4 / MUM1, CD 138. Included the GCB type was 65%. Impact prognostic index IPI >2 GBC vs non GBC p=0,038 X(2). Statistically significant difference was confirmed compared to the IPI > 2 to 3 year OS p<0,0005 X(2). Significantly longer three- year survival was provided in the group GCB 36 (92,3%) vs. non GCB 8 (38,1%) p=0,003 X(2). Clinical and immunohistochemical factors showed a significant impact to three- year survival by univariate: LDH p=0,005, MUM1 p=0,003, while CD10 p=0,069 was confirmed on the level of borderline impact. Using multivariate analysis, expression MUM1 has the greatest impact p<0.0005 OR=0.083 (95% CI 0.23-0.303) on the disease outcome - three- year survival. expression MUM1 >25% has the greatest impact on the disease outcome - three- year survival.
