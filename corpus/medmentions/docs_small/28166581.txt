28166581|t|A Student - Led Introduction to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health for First- Year Medical Students
28166581|a|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals face significant health disparities. This is in part because many physicians are not sensitive to, and/or are underprepared to address, LGBT - specific concerns. To help meet this need, we, a group of second- and fourth- year medical students with faculty oversight, organized a session on LGBT health for first- year medical students. The three second- year and one fourth- year student authors designed a mandatory session for the 167 first- years at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, OH. The 2-hour session consisted of a student - delivered presentation, a patient panel, and a small-group session. Students ' LGBT health knowledge and confidence in providing care were assessed anonymously before and after the session, and individuals ' pre - and post - session assessments were paired using student - generated identifiers. A total of 73 complete, matched pre -/ post - session assessments were received. Students ' familiarity with LGBT terminology and demographics increased significantly after the session. Students ' perceived preparedness and comfort in providing LGBT - specific care significantly improved in most areas as well. Students strongly praised the session, in particular the patient panel. A student - led educational session on LGBT health can effectively improve first- year medical students ' LGBT knowledge and confidence to provide care.
