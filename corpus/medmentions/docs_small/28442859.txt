28442859|t|Digital Myopericytoma: A Case Report and Systematic Literature Review
28442859|a|A myopericytoma (MP) is an exceedingly rare perivascular tumor of unknown etiology. Given their potential for mimicry and malignancy, MP tumors pose a unique challenge for surgeons and may be overlooked on differential diagnosis. We present a case report of an otherwise healthy 33-year-old right-hand dominant male who presented to our outpatient clinic with a 2-month history of painless swelling and erythema of the pulp of his left index finger. Subsequent plain film X-ray showed near-complete bony destruction of his distal phalanx. Pathological evaluation of an incisional biopsy showed a benign variant of MP. The lesion was treated by excision with tumor shelling, and there was no evidence of recurrence 81 days postoperatively. A systematic literature review of the management and outcome of all known cases of hand and wrist MP is presented.
