28263181|a|Cancer cells consume more glucose by glycolytic fermentation to lactate than by respiration, a characteristic known as the Warburg effect. In contrast with the 34 moles of ATP produced by respiration, fermentation produces two moles of ATP per mole of glucose consumed, which poses a puzzle on the function of the Warburg effect. Productions of free energy (ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) per mole linearly vary with the fraction (x) of glucose consumed by fermentation that is frequently estimated around 0.9. Hence, calculation shows that, in respect to pure respiration, the predominant fermentative metabolism decreases around 10% the production of entropy per mole of glucose consumed in cancer cells. We hypothesize that increased fermentation could allow cancer cells to accomplish the Prigogine theorem of the trend to minimize the rate of production of entropy. According the theorem, open cellular systems near the steady state could evolve to minimize the rates of entropy production that may be reached by modified replicating cells producing entropy at low rate. Remarkably, at CO2 concentrations above 930 ppm, glucose respiration produces less entropy than fermentation, which suggests experimental tests to validate the hypothesis of minimization of the rate of entropy production through the Warburg effect.
