28499343|t|Knee Loading Deficits During Dynamic Tasks in Individuals Following ACL Reconstruction
28499343|a|Study Design Controlled laboratory study, cross-sectional. Background Well documented deficits in sagittal plane knee loading, during dynamic tasks indicate individuals limit the magnitude of knee loading following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). It is unknown how these individuals modulate the speed of knee flexion during loading, which is particularly important as they progress to running during rehabilitation. Objective To investigate how individuals following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction perform dynamic knee loading tasks compared to healthy controls. Methods Two groups of recreationally active individuals participated; 15 healthy controls (CTRL) and 15 post-ACLR (ACLR). Participants performed 3 trials of over-ground running (RUN) and a single limb loading (SLL) task. Sagittal plane range of motion, peak knee extensor moment, peak knee flexion angular velocity, peak knee power absorption, and rate of knee extensor moment were calculated during deceleration. Mixed-factor multivariate analysis of variance was performed to compare differences in variables between groups (ACLR and CTRL), limbs (within ACLR) and tasks (within CTRL). Results Knee power absorption, knee flexion angular velocity and rate of knee extensor moment were decreased in reconstructed limbs (SLL :5.6W/kg; 325.8deg/s; 10.5Nm/kg/s, RUN :11.8W/kg; 421.4deg/s; 38.2Nm/kg/s, respectively) compared to non-surgical limbs (SLL :9.7W/kg; 432.0deg/s; 19.1Nm/kg/s, RUN :18.8W/kg; 494.1deg/s; 72.8Nm/kg/s, respectively) during both tasks (p<0.001). The magnitude of between limb differences in knee flexion angular velocity were similar in both tasks. Conclusion Despite lower loading demands during SLL, individuals post-ACLR exhibit deficits in knee dynamics during SLL and RUN suggesting an inability or reluctance to dynamically accommodate forces at the knee when progressing to running in rehabilitation.
