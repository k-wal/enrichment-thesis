27252904|t|Comparison of the Effects of Subcutaneous Versus Continuous Infusion of Heparin on Key Inflammatory Parameters Following Sepsis
27252904|a|Sepsis is the result of the interaction between inflammatory mediators and coagulation pathway. Unfractionated heparin may play a role as an anti-inflammatory agent beyond its anticoagulatory effect in sepsis. As a result, it may cause reduction in organ failure rate in patients with sepsis due to its impact on both inflammatory and coagulation process. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of heparin in sepsis. Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as an inflammatory mediator and urinary necoutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) as a marker of kidney injury were investigated. This prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a 32- bed intensive care unit. Thirty patients with sepsis were randomized to receive heparin infusion of 500 units/hour or 5000 units of heparin three times a day, subcutaneously. The plasma level of PAI-1 and urinary level of NGAL were determined at day 0, 2 and 7. The infusion group had a lower plasma PAI-1 level compared to the subcutaneous group at day 7 (11.3 ± 1.6 vs. 16.5 ± 4.2; P = 0.003). The urinary NGAL level was lower in the infusion group at day 2 (131.3 ± 11.9 vs. 151.2 ± 20.6; P = 0.014); however, at day 7 the NGAL level was decreased in the subcutaneous group as much as the infusion group and there was no significant difference between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores between the two groups at day 0, 2 and 7. Low-dose heparin infusion compared to subcutaneous heparin can decrease the plasma PAI-1 and urinary NGAL levels more rapidly. It can be related to anti-inflammatory effects of heparin, which may be more prominent in infusion route.
