28515617|t|A modified subgradient extragradient method for solving monotone variational inequalities
28515617|a|In the setting of Hilbert space, a modified subgradient extragradient method is proposed for solving Lipschitz-continuous and monotone variational inequalities defined on a level set of a convex function. Our iterative process is relaxed and self-adaptive, that is, in each iteration, calculating two metric projections onto some half-spaces containing the domain is involved only and the step size can be selected in some adaptive ways. A weak convergence theorem for our algorithm is proved. We also prove that our method has [Formula: see text] convergence rate.
