28351807|t|Profiles, sources and potential exposures of parent, chlorinated and brominated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in haze associated atmosphere
28351807|a|Profiles, sources and potential exposures of chlorinated and brominated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (ClPAHs and BrPAHs) in haze associated atmosphere remain unclear. Haze events happened frequently during heating period in Beijing provided a typical urban context to investigate the concentrations, profiles, sources and potential exposures of ClPAHs, BrPAHs and their non-halogenated parent compounds (PAHs) in air samples. Average concentrations of PAHs, ClPAHs and BrPAHs during heating periods (with more frequent haze events) were about 3-9 times higher than during non-heating periods. Concentrations of particulate matter (PM)- associated ClPAHs and BrPAHs were higher in heating period than in non-heating period, while for gas - associated ClPAHs and BrPAHs, this distinction was not significant. Congener patterns and congener profiles indicated that with increasing coal combustion during the heating period, concentrations of PAHs and ClPAHs in air were elevated in comparison to the non-heating period. Inhalation of PM - associated PAHs, ClPAHs and BrPAHs accounted for higher exposure than inhalation of gas phase and dermal contact of both gas phase and particulate phase. In this study we found that the particulate phase is the dominant exposure pathway of atmospheric PAHs, ClPAHs and BrPAHs during haze days, which is different from previous studies.
