28269453|a|Endurance is an important factor of cardiovascular fitness indicating the capacity of an individual to perform exercise for a longer duration with increased intensity. Various subject specific and exercise related parameters affect endurance of an individual. In this work, we propose a statistical technique to model endurance as a function of these factors incorporating the serial dependence of observations generated by individuals over time. The proposed model provides a device to predict future endurance of a test subject following particular exercise regime. This facilitates a test user with a fitness planner with the provision to fix exercise regimes to reach a set fitness goal.
