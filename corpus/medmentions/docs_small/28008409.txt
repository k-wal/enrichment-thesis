28008409|t|A Concurrent Case of Ménétrier's Disease and Signet Ring Carcinoma
28008409|a|Ménétrier's disease, also known as hyperplastic protein-losing gastropathy, is a rare, idiopathic, acquired, premalignant condition associated with gastric carcinoma. Its association with signet ring cell cancer of the stomach has been previously reported only twice. We present the third case of histologically confirmed concurrent Ménétrier's disease with signet ring carcinoma of the stomach, interrogated by esophagogastroduodenoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound.
