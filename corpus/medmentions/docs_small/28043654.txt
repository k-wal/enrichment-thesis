28043654|a|CK2 is a ubiquitous protein kinase involved in many cell functions. During the last years it became an interesting target in cancer research. A series of flavonoid compounds was tested as inhibitors of protein kinase CK2. Several substances were found to be highly active against both catalytic subunits with IC50 values below 1 μM in case of CK2α'. The most promising inhibitor we identified is chrysoeriol with IC50 values of 250 and 34 nM for CK2α and CK2α', respectively.
