27799048|t|Prostate external beam radiotherapy combined with high-dose-rate brachytherapy: dose - volume parameters from deformably-registered plans correlate with late gastrointestinal complications
27799048|a|Derivation of dose - volume correlated with toxicity for multi-modal treatments can be difficult due to the perceived need for voxel-by-voxel dose accumulation. With data available for a single - institution cohort with long follow-up, an investigation was undertaken into rectal dose - volume effects for gastrointestinal toxicities after deformably-registering each phase of a combined external beam radiotherapy (EBRT)/ high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy prostate treatment. One hundred and eighteen patients received EBRT in 23 fractions of 2 Gy and HDR (TG43 algorithm) in 3 fractions of 6.5 Gy. Results for the Late Effects of Normal Tissues - Subjective, Objective, Management and Analytic toxicity assessments were available with a median follow-up of 72 months. The HDR CT was deformably-registered to the EBRT CT. Doses were corrected for dose fractionation. Rectum dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters were calculated in two ways. (1) Distribution-adding: parameters were calculated after the EBRT dose distribution was 3D-summed with the registered HDR dose distribution. (2) Parameter-adding: the EBRT DVH parameters were added to HDR DVH parameters. Logistic regressions and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to correlate parameters with late peak toxicity (dichotomised at grade 1 or 2). The 48-80, 40-63 and 49-55 Gy dose regions from distribution-adding were significantly correlated with rectal bleeding, urgency / tenesmus and stool frequency respectively. Additionally, urgency / tenesmus and anorectal pain were associated with the 25-26 Gy and 44-48 Gy dose regions from distribution-adding respectively. Parameter-adding also indicated the low - mid dose region was significantly correlated with stool frequency and proctitis. This study confirms significant dose-histogram effects for gastrointestinal toxicities after including deformable registration to combine phases of EBRT / HDR prostate cancer treatment. The findings from distribution-adding were in most cases consistent with those from parameter-adding. The mid - high dose range and near maximum doses were important for rectal bleeding. The distribution-adding mid - high dose range was also important for stool frequency and urgency / tenesmus. We encourage additional studies in a variety of institutions using a variety of dose accumulation methods with appropriate inter-fraction motion management. NCT NCT00193856.
