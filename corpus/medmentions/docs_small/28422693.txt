28422693|t|Singularities of Three - Layered Complex-Valued Neural Networks With Split Activation Function
28422693|a|There are three important concepts related to learning processes in neural networks: reducibility, nonminimality, and singularity. Although the definitions of these three concepts differ, they are equivalent in real-valued neural networks. This is also true of complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with hidden neurons not employing biases. The situation of CVNNs with hidden neurons employing biases, however, is very complicated. Exceptional reducibility was found, and it was shown that reducibility and nonminimality are not the same. Irreducibility consists of minimality and exceptional reducibility. The relationship between minimality and singularity has not yet been established. In this paper, we describe our surprising finding that minimality and singularity are independent. We also provide several examples based on exceptional reducibility.
