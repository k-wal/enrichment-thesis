28241985|t|Cardiogenic shock caused by a left midventricular obstruction during refeeding in a patient with anorexia nervosa
28241985|a|Refeeding syndrome occurs when reinstating nutrition to severely malnourished patients. It can sometimes be fatal, particularly as a result of cardiac involvement such as congestive heart failure and arrhythmias. The aim of this study was to report a case of cardiogenic shock that occurred during refeeding in a patient with anorexia nervosa (AN). The cardiogenic shock was due to a previously unrecognized mechanism, namely a transient left midventricular obstruction that completely disappeared after treatment. A 46-y-old woman with AN who had followed a carbohydrate - and a fat - deficient diet for >10 y was hospitalized for dyspnea on exertion. She had severely impaired cardiac systolic function on admission and was considered high risk for refeeding syndrome. During a stepwise increase of calories, she showed no electrolyte or mineral abnormalities characteristic of refeeding syndrome. After intravenous administration of a fat emulsion, the patient suffered from cardiogenic shock due to an unexpected mechanism, namely a left midventricular obstruction caused by cardiac hypercontraction, a thickened left ventricular wall, and intravascular volume depletion. With cessation of the fat emulsion and initiation of volume repletion she recovered from shock immediately and her echocardiogram returned to normal by discharge. This case illustrated a novel cause of cardiogenic shock during refeeding and the need for caution during the intravenous administration of a fat emulsion in patients with initial left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
