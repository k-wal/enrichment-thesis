28385594|t|Synthesis of 4(3H)quinazolinimines with selective cytotoxic effect on human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells
28385594|a|We synthesized a new family of six 4(3H)quinazolinimines based on the reaction between (E)-N-(2-cyanophenyl)benzimidoyl chloride and substituted anilines reaching the formation of their corresponding C2, N3-substituted quinazoliniminium chlorides. This method provides novel, direct and flexible access to diverse substituted 4(3H)quinazolinimines. New compounds obtained following the proposed synthesis were fully characterized and, including the thirteen 4(3H)quinazolinimines synthesized by this method and previously reported by us, were used to study its cytotoxic effect on neoplastic cell lines. The mechanism involved in cell toxicity was also studied. Results showed that these compounds were highly cytotoxic, in particular on Human Promyelocytic Leukemia cells (HL60) and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia cells (K562) when compared with conventional antineoplastic drugs such as etoposide and cisplatin. The mechanism associated to cytotoxic effect was mainly apoptosis, which not was decreased by antioxidant addition, thereby suggesting that the compounds exert apoptotic death through a mechanism unrelated with oxidative stress.
