28471656|t|4-Anilino-2-pyridylquinazolines and - pyrimidines as Highly Potent and Nontoxic Inhibitors of Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2)
28471656|a|Multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport proteins remains a major problem in the chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer and might be overcome by inhibition of the transporter. Because of the lack of understanding, the complex mechanisms involved in the transport process, in particular for breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP / ABCG2), there is a persistent need for studies of inhibitors of ABCG2. In this study, we investigated a systematic series of 4-substituted-2-pyridylquinazolines in terms of their inhibitory potency as well as selectivity toward ABCG2. For comparison, the quinazoline scaffold was reduced to the significantly smaller 4-methylpyrimidine basic structure. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity and the ability to reverse MDR was tested with the chemotherapeutic agents SN-38 and mitoxantrone (MX). Interaction of the compounds with ABCG2 was investigated by a colorimetric ATPase assay. Enzyme kinetic studies were carried out with Hoechst 33342 as fluorescent dye and substrate of ABCG2 to elucidate the compounds binding modes.
