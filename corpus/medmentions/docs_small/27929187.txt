27929187|t|Selective remote esterification of 8-aminoquinoline amides via copper(ii) -catalyzed C(sp(2))-O cross-coupling reaction
27929187|a|The remote C-O coupling of quinoline amides at the C5 position has been established using cheap and readily available copper catalyst under mild conditions. The positionally selective esterification protocol afforded C-O coupling products in moderate to excellent yields. Most importantly, this method may provide a potential alternative to the existing ways to build functionalized 5-hydroxyquinoline derivatives, which are utilized as pivotal intermediates in the synthesis of drug candidates.
