28147376|t|Solifenacin in the Elderly: Results of an Observational Study Measuring Efficacy, Tolerability and Cognitive Effects
28147376|a|The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of solifenacin in older patients with overactive bladder (OAB). Observational data on patients aged ≥70 years and the prescribed flexible dose of solifenacin for OAB were collected at 294 offices of German general practitioners. Baseline and week 12 data included type and severity of OAB symptoms, adverse events, quality of life, and change in cognitive function per Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Mean age of 774 patients was 78 ± 6 years. A decrease was observed in all OAB symptoms including a reduction of urinary urgency and micturition, each by 4 episodes per 24 h. No change in mean MMSE score s was apparent at week 12. Adverse events and treatment discontinuations were low at 5.8 and 0.5%, respectively. Solifenacin was well-tolerated while OAB symptoms declined at week 12. No relevant effect of solifenacin on cognitive function was observed in this elderly population.
