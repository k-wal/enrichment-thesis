27980739|t|Myopotential oversensing notified by Lead Integrity Alert in a patient with implantable cardioverter defibrillator with a dedicated bipolar epicardial sensing lead
27980739|a|Although myopotential oversensing by a dedicated bipolar lead is rare, an epicardial lead on a dilated ventricle might contribute to its sensitivity. Myopotential oversensing was notified by the Lead Integrity Alert in this case. We should be aware of this possibility for the management of such patients.
