28493435|t|A Fast Peak-Searching Algorithm for Ultrasonic Elastography
28493435|a|Tissue axial strain estimation with ultrasound elastography has become a hot field in recent years. However, for keypoints tracking-based elastography algorithms, locating extrema in multimodal ultrasonic radiofrequency signals is still a challenging problem. In this paper, a new method is proposed to locate the local maxima and minima of the RF signals directly without derivation operation. This algorithm can accurately locate extrema even if disturbed peaks resulting from different noise exist. Furthermore, the new algorithm can speed up approximately 79% of the implementation process as compared with the standard cross-correlation method on the same computing platform. In addition, the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio and the contrast-to-noise ratio are also significantly improved with this new method.
