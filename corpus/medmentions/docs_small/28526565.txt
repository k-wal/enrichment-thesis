28526565|t|Efficacy of indefinite chronic oral antimicrobial suppression for prosthetic joint infection in the elderly: a comparative study
28526565|a|During prosthetic joint infection (PJI), surgical management is sometimes impossible, indefinite chronic oral antimicrobial suppression (ICOAS) may sometimes be the only option. We evaluated the outcome of elderly patients who benefited from ICOAS for a strictly palliative goal METHODS: We performed a national retrospective cohort study in France of patients aged >75years old with PJI, and managed with ICOAS planned for life long from 2009 to 2014, and compared the population with an event versus the population free of event. Event was defined as a composite outcome in patients under ICOAS, including: local or systemic progression of the infection; death or discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy because of adverse drug reaction. Twenty-one patients were included, with a median age of 85 (IQR: 81; 88) years old. There were 8/21 patients with an event: 1 patient with adverse drug reaction; 3 patients had systemic progression of sepsis; and 2 had local progression. A total of 2/21 patients died. No deaths were related to ICOAS or infection. There was no significant difference (p >0.05) between the population with an event and free of event considering demographic, clinical and microbiological characteristics. In our cohort, ICOAS seems to be an effective and safe option.
