28380217|t|Synthesis of Some Unique Carbamate Derivatives bearing 2-Furoyl-1-piperazine as a Valuable Therapeutic Agents
28380217|a|The aim of the research work was to synthesize different biologically active carbamate derivatives bearing 2-furoyl-1-piperazine and having modest toxicity. The synthesis was completed as a multiple sequence. The structural confirmation of all the synthesized compounds was obtained by EI-MS, IR and 1H-NMR spectral data. The enzyme inhibition and antibacterial potential of the synthesized compounds was evaluated. To find the utility of the prepared compounds as possible therapeutic agents their cytotoxicity was also checked. All the compounds were active against acetylcholinesterase enzyme, especially 12 and 14 showed very good inhibitory potential relative to Eserine, a reference standard. Almost all the compounds showed good activities against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains.
