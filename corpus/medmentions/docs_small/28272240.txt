28272240|t|A 92- year - old man with primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma manifesting as a giant scalp mass: A case report
28272240|a|Primary cutaneous non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is an uncommon entity, representing 10% of all extranodal NHLs. Among all cutaneous sites, the scalp is a rare site of representation. A 92- year -old Chinese man visited our hospital with a multiple-nodular huge scalp mass on the right parieto-occipital regions. The mass was of 7- month duration and progressively enlarging in size. On the basis of the result of biopsy, diffuse large B-cell NHL was diagnosed. The mass was partially resected by surgery and no further treatment was conducted due to the advanced age and poor physical status. The tumor relapsed in situ after 6 months and the patient died after 2 years. This case highlighted the limited access to standard treatment options in patients with advanced age. A thorough examination is necessary to decide upon the treatment for the primary cutaneous lymphoma.
