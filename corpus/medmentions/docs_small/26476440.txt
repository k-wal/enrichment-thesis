26476440|t|Promoting lifestyle behaviour change and well-being in hospital patients: a pilot study of an evidence-based psychological intervention
26476440|a|Lifestyle risk behaviours show an inverse social gradient, clustering in vulnerable groups. We designed and piloted an intervention to address barriers to lifestyle behaviour change among hospital patients. We designed our intervention using effective components of behaviour change interventions informed by psychological theory. Delivered by a health psychologist based at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, the 4-week intervention included detailed baseline assessment, personalized goal setting, psychological skills development, motivation support and referral to community services. Primary outcomes were feasibility and patient acceptability. We also evaluated changes to health and well-being. From 1 July 2013 to 31 September 2014, 686 patients were referred, 338 (49.3%) attended a first appointment and 172 (25.1%) completed follow-up. Furthermore, 72.1% of attenders were female with the median age 55 years and poor self-reported baseline health. After 4 weeks, self-efficacy, health and well-being scores significantly improved: 63% of lifestyle goals and 89% of health management goals were fully achieved; 58% of referrals to community lifestyle behaviour change services and 79% of referrals to other services (e.g. Citizen's Advice Bureau) were accepted; 99% were satisfied / very satisfied with the service. Our hospital-based intervention was feasible, acceptable and showed preliminary health and well-being gains.
