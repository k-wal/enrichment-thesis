27342305|a|To examine the validity of the Psychosocial Assessment Tool (PAT) with families of infants (<2 years) and children admitted to hospital with acute life-threatening illnesses. METHODS: A total of 235 parents of 177 children admitted to oncology, cardiology, or pediatric intensive care completed the PAT and measures of acute stress, trait anxiety, family functioning, and quality of life, a mean 3.7 weeks following diagnosis. A modified PAT was used for families of infants, rendering two forms, PAT (<2) and PAT (2+). RESULTS: Psychometrics for PAT (<2) and PAT (2+) were acceptable. PAT Total and Subscale scores for each version were significantly correlated with validation measures. Internal consistency for PAT subscales was variable. Receiver Operating Characteristics provided some support for PAT cutoffs. PAT scores across illness groups were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides promising support for the PAT as a psychosocial screener for families of infants and older children across illness conditions.
