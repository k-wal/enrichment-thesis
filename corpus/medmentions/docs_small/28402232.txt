28402232|a|Multifactorial workloads such as whole-body vibration (WBV), awkward posture and heavy lifting are potential predictors for low back pain (LBP). In this study, we investigate the association between LBP and these exposures among 102 professional drivers. The combined exposures of WBV and posture are measured at different workplaces. Health and personal data as well as information about lifting tasks are collected by a questionnaire. The daily vibration exposure value (odds ratio 1.69) and an index for awkward posture (odds ratio 1.63) show significant association with the occurence of LBP. Awkward posture and heavy lifting appear to be more strongly associated with sick leave than WBV exposure. Furthermore, a combination of the measurement results of WBV and awkward posture into one quantity also shows significant correlation to LBP. The combined exposure of WBV and awkward posture can be described in terms of the daily vibration exposure and the index for awkward posture. This facilitates work place assessments and future research in this area. Practitioner Summary: For the first time, quantitative measures combining whole-body vibration and awkward posture exposures have shown to correlate with the occurrence of low back pain significantly. This validates the proposed quantities and measurement methods, which facilitate workplace assessments and assist in the design of further studies which are necessary to establish a causal exposure - response relationship.
