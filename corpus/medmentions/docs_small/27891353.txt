27891353|t|Association of C-Reactive Protein (rs1205) Gene Polymorphism with Susceptibility to Psoriasis in South Indian Tamils
27891353|a|Psoriasis is a multi-factorial heritable T-helper Th-1 / Th-17 mediated inflammatory disease, affecting the skin. It is associated with co-morbidities such as Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a good inflammatory marker. CRP rs1205 polymorphism is associated with circulating plasma CRP levels. Although there is association between the rs1205 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) and CVD, there are no prior reports regarding the association of CRP rs1205 SNP with psoriasis susceptibility. To study the association of the genetic variant rs1205 in the CRP gene with susceptibility to the disease and protein levels in South Indian Tamils with psoriasis. In this case-control genetic study, 300 cases of psoriasis and 300 age and gender matched controls were genotyped for CRP SNP rs1205 using Taq Man 5'allele discrimination assay at Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry, India from February 2014 to January 2016. Plasma high sensitivity (hs)- CRP levels were estimated by ELISA. Disease severity was assessed by Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI). CRP genetic variation rs1205 was not associated with psoriasis risk in our South Indian Tamil population. However, the circulating levels of hs - CRP was significantly higher in patients with psoriasis, as compared with controls (p < 0.0001) and the protein levels were significantly associated with disease severity, as assessed by PASI scoring. No genotype was found significantly associated with PASI or CRP levels. Our results suggest that plasma CRP levels are higher in patients with psoriasis and correlate with disease severity, whilst CRP rs1205 is not associated with susceptibility to psoriasis in South Indian Tamils.
