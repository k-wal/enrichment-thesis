28456744|a|The proportion of females among neurosurgeons appears to be growing worldwide with time. Official data concerning the current situation across Europe have not yet been published. Thus, there are still concerns about gender inequality. The E-WIN Project 2016 was designed to recognize the current situation across Europe. The office holders of the national neurosurgical societies of 39 countries forming the EANS were contacted to provide data stating the proportion of females in neurosurgery. Obtained data were supplied with the results of an online survey. The response rate of national office holders was 90%. Total number of reported neurosurgeons was n=12985, overall proportion of females represented 12%. A total of n=237 responses to online questionnaire were taken into account. The overall proportion of female responders was 30%. There was no inter- gender variability in responses regarding amount of working time per week, exposure to surgeries or administrative work. Male responders reported dedicating significantly more time to scientific work and feeling more confident dictating own career direction. Female responders reported being less often married, having a smaller number of children, a stronger perception of gender significance level and a higher appreciation of personal qualities. Neurosurgery is challenging field of medicine. The results of our survey did not imply an overall feeling of gender inequality among European responders, although women feel the gender issue to be more important than men, and have to sacrifice more of their personal life.
