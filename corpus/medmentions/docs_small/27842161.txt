27842161|t|Netarsudil Increases Outflow Facility in Human Eyes Through Multiple Mechanisms
27842161|a|Netarsudil is a Rho kinase/norepinephrine transporter inhibitor currently in phase 3 clinical development for glaucoma treatment. We investigated the effects of its active metabolite, netarsudil-M1, on outflow facility (C), outflow hydrodynamics, and morphology of the conventional outflow pathway in enucleated human eyes. Paired human eyes (n = 5) were perfused with either 0.3 Î¼M netarsudil-M1 or vehicle solution at constant pressure (15 mm Hg). After 3 hours, fluorescent microspheres were added to perfusion media to trace the outflow patterns before perfusion - fixation. The percentage effective filtration length (PEFL) was calculated from the measured lengths of tracer distribution in the trabecular meshwork (TM), episcleral veins (ESVs), and along the inner wall (IW) of Schlemm's canal after global and confocal imaging. Morphologic changes along the trabecular outflow pathway were investigated by confocal, light, and electron microscopy. Perfusion with netarsudil-M1 significantly increased C when compared to baseline (51%, P < 0.01) and to paired controls (102%, P < 0.01), as well as significantly increased PEFL in both IW (P < 0.05) and ESVs (P < 0.01). In treated eyes, PEFL was significantly higher in ESVs than in the IW (P < 0.01) and was associated with increased cross-sectional area of ESVs (P < 0.01). Percentage effective filtration length in ESVs positively correlated with the percentage change in C (R2 = 0.58, P = 0.01). A significant increase in juxtacanalicular connective tissue (JCT) thickness (P < 0.05) was found in treated eyes compared to controls. Netarsudil acutely increased C by expansion of the JCT and dilating the ESVs, which led to redistribution of aqueous outflow through a larger area of the IW and ESVs.
