28418171|a|Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and formation of oxysterols, which could have a negative health effect. The formation and distribution of oxysterols was studied in meatloaves prepared under different baking regimes with increased temperature or prolonged time. The effect of frozen storage and marjoram addition on the level of oxysterols was studied as well. The effect of baking regime on the content and distribution of oxysterols was found. The temperature was the most important factor affecting 7-ketocholesterol formation in baked meatloaf. Its content was significantly higher after the baking at 250 °C than at 180 °C. The content of 7-ketocholesterol increased from the centre (87 µg kg(-1)) to the surface (122 µg kg(-1)) of baked meatloaf prepared under the standard conditions. The level of α-tocopherol and its distribution was also affected by the baking regime. Higher level of 7-ketocholesterol was found in the baked meatloaves after their frozen storage. The addition of marjoram did not change its level. Inadequate culinary conditions used for preparation of baked meat can contribute to increased oxysterol intake in the diet. Frozen storage did not stop oxysterols formation. The inhibition effect of marjoram on sterols oxidation was not proved.
