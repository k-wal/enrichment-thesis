28074666|t|Association between posttraumatic stress and acceptance of social changes: Findings from a general population study and proposal of a new concept
28074666|a|There is a growing understanding of the importance of the social factors of posttraumatic stress disorder. This study expands research on association between posttraumatic stress and social factors by introducing the measure of the acceptance of social changes and evaluating possible links between posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms and acceptance of social changes. A general population sample (n = 778) aged from 18 to 89 years (M = 40.2) from Lithuania participated in our study, of whom 68% reported exposure to traumatic events. Posttraumatic stress reactions were measured with the Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R), and acceptance of social changes was measured with the Acceptance of Social Changes Instrument (SOCHI) developed by the authors of this study. About 8% of the participants had a potential posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis. Acceptance of social changes was negatively associated with posttraumatic stress. PTSD was related to lower acceptance of social changes (d = .61). Structural equation model (SEM) revealed the mediating role of PTSD for acceptance of social changes following trauma exposure. Findings of our study indicate that the acceptance of social changes might be an important psychosocial factor of PTSD.
