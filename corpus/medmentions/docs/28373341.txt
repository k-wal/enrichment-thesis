28373341|a|The distribution of health care expenditures remains highly concentrated, but most Americans use few health care resources and have low out-of-pocket spending. More than 93 percent of " low spenders " (those in the bottom half of the population) believe they have received all needed care in a timely manner. The low spending by the majority of the population has remained almost unchanged during the thirty-seven- year period examined.
