28435583|t|Ulnar Osteotomy with 2-Pin Unilateral Gradual Distraction for Treatment of Chronic Monteggia Fracture: A Case Report
28435583|a|Missed Monteggia fracture leading to chronic radial head dislocation is a known complication. The surgical treatment options remain challenging. The aim of treatment is to reduce the radial head and to maintain the stability of the elbow in all ranges of motion. A few surgical techniques have been described with complications. We report the case of a 13 years old boy with chronic radial head dislocation as a result of an unrecognised Monteggia fracture - dislocation for eight years. We successfully reduced the radial head and corrected the cubital valgus from 45 degrees to 10 degrees with a proximal ulna osteotomy and gradual distraction with 2-pin Monotube external fixator. The correction was uneventful with good functional outcome.
