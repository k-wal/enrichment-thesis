27580610|a|Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients have high risk for anxiety and depression. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of anxiety and depression in SLE patients in Southwest China. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling from Rheumatic Outpatient Clinic of West China Hospital Sichuan University between August and October 2014. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Risk factors were explored by multiple logistic regression analyses. A total of 352 participants were enrolled, of who 64 (18.2 %) met the HADS criteria for anxiety and 82 (23.3 %) for depression. In multivariable analysis, higher levels of pain (OR = 1.17, P = 0.02) and fatigue (OR = 1.19, P < 0.01) predicted a higher risk of anxiety. Similarly, a higher level of fatigue (OR = 1.2, P < 0.01) was associated with a higher risk of depression. The results suggest that anxiety and depression are common in patients with SLE in Southwest China. Health care providers and SLE patients should take some measures to cope with them as early as possible. Strengthening management of pain and fatigue may be useful. But further studies are needed to verify these findings.
