28508668|t|Total synthesis and neuroprotective effect of O-methylmurrayamine A and 7-methoxymurrayacine
28508668|a|O-Methylmurrayamine A (7) and 7-methoxymurrayacine (8) are natural products isolated from Murraya koenigii and Murraya siamensis, respectively. In this paper, we report the synthesis of 7 and 8 which are featured in the key step of cyclization to form carbazole intermediate 5 with mild conditions. The structures were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, and HR-ESI-MS. In addition, compounds 7 and 8 were tested for their neuroprotective effects against H2O2 -induced PC12 cell damage. The results showed that compounds 7 and 8 have neuroprotective effect.
