28210819|a|The cognitive system can be updated rapidly and efficiently to maximize performance in cognitive tasks. This paper used a task - switching task to explore updating at the level of the plausible task -sets held for future performance. Previous research suggested a " fadeout effect ", performance improvement when moving from task - switching context to single-task context, yet this effect could reflect passive learning rather than intentional control. In a novel " informed fadeout paradigm ", one of two tasks was canceled for a certain number of trials and participants were informed or uninformed regarding task cancelation. The " informed fadeout effect " indicates better performance in the informed than uninformed fadeout after one informed trial had been executed. However, the results regarding the first trial were inconclusive. Possible underlying mechanisms are discussed.
