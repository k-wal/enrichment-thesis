27240560|t|Consumption of fruits and vegetables associated with other risk behaviors among adolescents in Northeast Brazil
27240560|a|To determine the prevalence of consumption of fruits and vegetables and identify the association with low level of physical activity, exposure to sedentary behavior, consumption of soft drinks and overweight / obesity in adolescents. This is a cross-sectional school-based study with a representative sample of 3992 students aged 14-19 years from the state of Sergipe, Brazil. The outcome was low consumption of fruits and vegetables (<5 servings/day). Independent variables were: level of physical activity, sedentary behavior, consumption of soft drinks, and overweight / obesity. Global Student Health Survey questionnaire and body mass and height measurements were used, as well as chi-square test and crude and adjusted binary logistic regression. The significance level adopted was 5%. The prevalence of inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables was high - 88.6% (95% CI =87.6-89.5). Higher likelihood of low consumption of fruits and vegetables was verified among boys who were exposed to sedentary behavior (OR =1.63; 95% CI =1.18-2.24), who consumed soft drinks (OR =3.04; 95% CI =2.10-4.40), with insufficiently physical activity (OR =1.98; 95% CI =1.43-2.73) and girls who consumed soft drinks (OR =1.88; 95% CI =1.43-2.47) and those with overweight / obesity (OR =1.63; 95% CI =1.19-2.23). There is a need of public policies aimed at encouraging the consumption of healthy foods among adolescents.
