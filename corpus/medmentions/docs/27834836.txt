27834836|t|Proteomic Analysis of Tung Tree (Vernicia fordii) Oilseeds during the Developmental Stages
27834836|a|The tung tree (Vernicia fordii), a non-model woody plant belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family, is a promising economic plant due to the high content of a novel high-value oil in its seeds. Many metabolic pathways are active during seed development. Oil (triacylglycerols (TAGs)) accumulates in oil bodies distributed in the endosperm cells of tung tree seeds. The relationship between oil bodies and oil content during tung tree seed development was analyzed using ultrastructural observations, which confirmed that oil accumulation was correlated with the volumes and numbers of oil bodies in the endosperm cells during three different developmental stages. For a deeper understanding of seed development, we carried out proteomic analyses. At least 144 proteins were differentially expressed during three different developmental stages. A total of 76 proteins were successfully identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS / MS). These proteins were grouped into 11 classes according to their functions. The major groups of differentially expressed proteins were associated with energy metabolism (25%), fatty acid metabolism (15.79%) and defense (14.47%). These results strongly suggested that a very high percentage of gene expression in seed development is dedicated to the synthesis and accumulation of TAGs.
