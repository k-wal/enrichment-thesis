28424683|a|Natural killer (NK) cells are known to target cancer stem cells and undifferentiated tumors. In this paper, we provide a novel strategy for expanding large numbers of super-charged NK cells with significant potential to lyse and differentiate cancer stem cells and demonstrate the differences in the dynamics of NK cell expansion between healthy donors and cancer patients. Decline in cytotoxicity and lower interferon (IFN)-γ secretion by osteoclast (OC)-expanded NK cells from cancer patients correlates with faster expansion of residual contaminating T cells within purified NK cells, whereas healthy donors ' OCs continue expanding super-charged NK cells while limiting T cell expansion for up to 60 days. Similar to patient NK cells, NK cells from tumor -bearing BLT-humanized mice promote faster expansion of residual T cells resulting in decreased numbers and function of NK cells, whereas NK cells from mice with no tumor continue expanding NK cells and retain their cytotoxicity. In addition, dendritic cells (DCs) in contrast to OCs are found to promote faster expansion of residual T cells within purified NK cells resulting in the decline in NK cell numbers from healthy individuals. Addition of anti-CD3 mAb inhibits T cell proliferation while enhancing NK cell expansion; however, expanding NK cells have lower cytotoxicity but higher secretion of IFN-γ. Expansion and functional activation of super-charged NK cells by OCs is dependent on interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-15. Thus, in this report, we not only provide a novel strategy to expand super-charged NK cells, but also demonstrate that rapid and sustained expansion of residual T cells within the purified NK cells during expansion with DCs or OCs could be a potential mechanism by which the numbers and function of NK cells decline in cancer patients and in BLT-humanized mice.
