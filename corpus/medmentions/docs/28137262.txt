28137262|a|The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to clarify the safety and efficacy of total hip arthroplasty via the direct anterior approach in the supine position with a novel mobile traction table. The first experience of consecutive surgeries by a single surgeon using the direct anterior approach with a traction table is described with a two-year follow-up period. Of 121 patients, 100 patients without previous hip surgeries, severe deformity, or cemented implants were divided into two groups comprising the first 50 patients and the second 50 patients. The implant survival rate was 99% at the two-year follow-up. Revision surgery was required for periprosthetic femoral fracture in one patient. The complication rate possibly related to the traction table was 5% (5 patients): three anterior dislocations, one periprosthetic femoral fracture, and one intraoperative perforation caused by femoral rasping. The complication rate tended to decrease in the second group compared to the first group (4% versus 6%). Mean surgical time (72.0 minutes versus 82.5 min, p = 0.027), rate of allogeneic blood transfusion (2% versus 24%, p = 0.001), and cup alignment in the safe zone (100% versus 88%, p = 0.027) were significantly improved in the second group compared to the first group. The direct anterior approach with a novel mobile traction table showed a positive learning curve for surgical time, rate of allogeneic blood transfusion, and cup alignment in the safe zone.
