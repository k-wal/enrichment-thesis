28099370|t|A Course -Based Approach to the Doctor of Nursing Practice Project: Supporting Student Growth From Concept to Completion
28099370|a|We describe a course -based approach to the doctor of nursing practice project in which students work in groups of 8 to 12 with a faculty member to complete individual final projects that require a minimum of 360 practicum hours in 3- semester -long courses. Project teams include agency or community -based mentors. Project findings are disseminated through written and oral reports. This approach preserves faculty resources and provides students with mentoring, opportunities for reflection, and time for project development.
