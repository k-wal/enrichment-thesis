28450196|t|Receipt of thyroid hormone deficiency treatment and risk of herpes zoster
28450196|a|Thyroid hormone (TH) has been suggested to control herpes virus gene expression and replication in neurons via epigenetics through its nuclear receptors. It has previously been shown that patients with hypothyroidism are predisposed to herpes zoster (HZ), suggesting that the TH deficiency may be a risk factor for varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that TH treatment will ameliorate the complication of HZ. This study investigated the hypothesis by enquiring into a comprehensive medical database at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) to verify whether patients taking TH medication experience a reduction in HZ occurrence. It was shown by Kaplan-Meier analysis that hypothyroidism patients taking TH medicines had a lower risk of HZ. The fully adjusted analysis indicated that patients receiving medication for the treatment of TH deficiency exhibited a reduced risk of HZ (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.51-0.71). This lower risk of HZ was significant in all age groups except the 18-39 years cohort. In addition, female patients taking TH treatment exhibited a lower risk than their male counterparts. Together these findings support the hypothesis that a constant level of TH will provide a degree of protection from contracting HZ. More studies are underway to evaluate the laboratory data for an analysis of hormonal effects on individuals.
