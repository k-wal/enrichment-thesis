27686752|a|Patient satisfaction is known to increase with pharmacist intervention in general outpatient clinics and with nurse-led care in rheumatology clinics. The aim of the present study was to describe and compare patient satisfaction with two different types of care: a pharmacist physician collaborative model and a traditional physician model in a rheumatology clinic setting. A cross-sectional survey of inflammatory arthritis patients seen during a follow-up visit in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was conducted over a ten-week period. Patient satisfaction was measured using a modified version of the validated Leeds Satisfaction Questionnaire, which uses a five-point Likert scale to measure six dimensions of satisfaction, and compared between the collaborative care and traditional physician models. A total of 62 patients completed the questionnaire (21 collaborative care and 41 traditional physician model). The average age of respondents was 52 years and the majority were female. The mean score for satisfaction across the six dimensions was 4.56 in the collaborative care group and 4.30 in the traditional physician group (p = 0.02). Patient satisfaction in the collaborative care group was consistently higher across all dimensions. No difference was noted between participants seen for the first time compared with those seen two or more times by the pharmacist. A collaborative care model can exceed the already high expectations for care of patients with inflammatory arthritis. Our findings support the role of pharmacists using a collaborative care approach to care for patients in rheumatology clinics.
