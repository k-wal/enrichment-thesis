27441491|a|There was a lack of data about foreign body (FB) ingestion among Middle-East children. We conducted a retrospective analysis of FB ingestion among Egyptian children and determined the predictors that affect the occurrence of complications. This retrospective study was carried out on 1546 patients ' ≤ 13 years old, presented with FB ingestion and were in need of endoscopic removal of FB. There were 711 males (46%) and 835 females (54%) (mean age 4.56 ±2.26 years). Symptoms were present in 1414 patients (91.5%) while complications were present in 137 patients (8.9%). There was a significant difference between complicated and non-complicated cases as regard higher age group, duration of impaction, site of impaction and type of FB (p= 0.001, 0.001, 0.001 and <0.001, respectively). The highest rate of complications was observed in FB impacted in duodenum and those without symptoms while symptomatic cases and impaction in upper esophagus were associated with higher success rate of removal.
