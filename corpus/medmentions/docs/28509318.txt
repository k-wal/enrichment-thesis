28509318|a|The literature presents only few reports regarding the effects of elevated levels of aromatic hydrocarbons (AH) on the functions of the human placenta. The effects of environmental contamination with AH (including phenol and 1-hydroxypyrene) have certain negative effects on parenchymal organs such as human placenta. The paper aimed to assess the effects of elevated levels of AH on the placental angiogenesis and elements of the mesenchymal tissue of the placenta. Tissue material from 50 afterbirths from Płock constituted a study group, whereas 50 afterbirths from Kutno constituted a control group. Immunohistochemical reactions with the peroxidase method using LSAB kits (DAKO) were performed. The extent and intensity of reactions were analysed. The levels of phenols and 1-hydroxypyrene in the excreted urine of pregnant women (undergoing delivery) were detected using gas chromatography and colorimetry. The levels of phenol and 1-hydroxypyrene in the excreted urine were demonstrated to be statistically significantly higher in patients living in the area of Płock. Statistically significantly higher expression of antibodies indicating placental angiogenesis was observed in the placentas in the Płock group (p < 0.01). Moreover, lower expression of vimentin indicating reactions with proteins in mesenchymal cells was observed in the Kutno group (p < 0.01). Pregnancy in the environment with elevated levels of aromatic hydrocarbons has detrimental effects on the human placenta. The foetus is protected by activation of adaptation and compensation mechanisms that are manifested as significant angiogenesis and greater development and differentiation of mesenchymal cells compared to the control group.
