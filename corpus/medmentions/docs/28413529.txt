28413529|a|The aim was to investigate the incidence and pattern of neuroendocrine changes in cases of acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Endocrine assessment was performed in 100 consecutive cases of acute aneurysmal SAH presenting within 7 days of ictus. The gonadotropic, somatotrophic, thyrotropic, and corticotrophic axes were evaluated for their possible dysfunction. A total of 100 cases (38 males, 62 females; age range - 17-76 years; mean age - 43.6 years) of acute SAH were studied. The aneurysms were located in the anterior circulation (n = 95) and posterior circulation (n = 5). The most common hormone deficiency was of growth hormone (n = 67), followed by gonadotrophin (n = 50), corticotrophin (n = 49) and thyrotrophin (n = 35). Hyperprolactinemia was noted in 10 cases. One-pituitary hormone axis deficiency was noted in 26 cases while 67 cases had two or more pituitary hormone axes dysfunction. A total of 93 cases had hormonal dysfunction in one or more pituitary hormone axes, and seven cases had no hormonal dysfunction. Endocrine dysfunction occurs in 93% cases of acute SAH and multiple pituitary hormone axes dysfunction occurs in 67% cases. It is suggested that hormonal evaluation should be considered as part of management of acute SAH.
