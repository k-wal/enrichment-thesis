28461000|t|Potential Sunitinib - Induced Coronary Artery and Aortic Dissections
28461000|a|Small-molecule multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy is used in different types of cancer. These drugs have been associated with cardiovascular toxicity, including aortic dissection. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a coronary dissection potentially associated with a TKI treatment has been described.
