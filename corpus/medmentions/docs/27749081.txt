27749081|t|Dependence of Intestinal Absorption Profile of Insulin on Carrier Morphology Composed of β-Cyclodextrin-Grafted Chitosan
27749081|a|The effect of carrier morphology on the intestinal absorption of insulin was investigated using a morphology-tunable polymeric carrier, β-cyclodextrin-grafted chitosan (BCC). The insulin - BCC complexes were prepared in either acetate or citrate buffer solutions, followed by dilution with phosphate buffer for the administration. The complex had a molecular network structure in the acetate buffer, whereas nanoparticles formed in the citrate buffer. The network structure in the acetate buffer was maintained even after dilution with a phosphate buffer, but the nanoparticles in the citrate buffer caused aggregation after dilution. Both complexes enhanced the intestinal absorption of insulin. Interestingly, their absorption profiles were totally different; prompt absorption was observed for the complex prepared in acetate buffer, whereas sustained absorption was observed for the complex prepared in citrate buffer. The difference in the absorption patterns was attributed to the difference in the complex morphology. Next, penetratin, a cell-penetrating peptide, was grafted to BCC to find further improvement in the absorption behavior. A simple mixture of penetratin and BCC was also effective. An oral administration study was also conducted in mice to observe effective suppression of glucose levels, which was further enhanced by coadministration of penetratin. Thus, BCC was proven to be an effective carrier for enhancing oral absorption of peptide drugs, and it is suggested that the carrier morphology is also an important factor that influences the absorption profile.
