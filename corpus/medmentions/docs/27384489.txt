27384489|t|Relationship between LRRK2 R1628P polymorphism and Parkinson's disease in Asian populations
27384489|a|Although the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) R1628P polymorphism has been associated with the risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in Taiwan, China, and Singapore, there are conflicting findings regarding this relationship. Thus, the aim of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the associations between the LRRK2 R1628P polymorphism (rs33949390) and PD in Asian populations. A search for eligible studies was performed in PubMed, Embase, SinoMed, and the China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database, and pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the strength of the association between the R1628P polymorphism and PD. This meta-analysis assessed 19 studies from 14 papers that involved a total of 9,927 PD patients and 8,602 controls and found that the R1628P polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of PD in Asian populations. Moreover, stratification analyses indicated that the R1628P polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of PD among Chinese as well as non-Chinese Asian populations and an increased risk of PD in Chinese patients from China, Taiwan, and Singapore. In a stratified analysis conducted according to age, significant associations were found for both late-onset PD and early-onset PD. The present data indicate that the R1628P polymorphism of the LRRK2 gene contributes to PD susceptibility in Asian, especially Chinese, populations.
