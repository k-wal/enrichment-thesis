27484439|a|The present study aims to study the prevalence of depression in patients with uncomplicated type II diabetes mellitus and to find its association with various socio-demographic factors in the same. A cross-sectional, single interview study was performed in an outpatient department of an endocrinology institute. Total 80 type II DM patients without any associated complications of diabetes were included in this study. To diagnose Depressive Episode, structured clinical interview for DSM V was applied. Severity of depression was assessed by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). To assess socio-demographic characteristics of the patients, all of them were evaluated with a semi-structured socio-demographic performa. 38.75% patients (N=31) were found to be suffering from depression. Among them 48.38% were moderately depressed and none were suffering from very severe depression. Significant association was not found between depression and socio-demographic factors of age (p=0.920), gender (p=0.251), economic profile (p=0.583), local background of the patient (p=0.646), educational qualification (p=0.935) and marital status (p=0.644). Similarly no association was found with duration of diabetes, HbA1c and BMI. Exclusion of complicated cases didn't seem to influence overall prevalence of depression, although reduction in severity was apparent. Thus even in those diabetic patients who are leading a complication free life, a detailed psychiatric analysis to rule out depression is mandatory.
