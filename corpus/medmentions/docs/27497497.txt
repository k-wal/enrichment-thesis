27497497|t|The lost art of the splenorrhaphy
27497497|a|In the case of the hemodynamically unstable child, splenorrhaphy is preferred to splenectomy to avert postsplenectomy sepsis. However, successful splenorrhaphy requires familiarity with the procedure. We sought to determine how many splenectomies or splenorrhaphies for trauma the average pediatric surgeon can be expected to perform during their career. The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) Database was queried for patients â‰¤18 years coded with an International Classification of Diseases 9th Edition diagnosis code of a splenic injury from 2004 to 2013. Age, gender, grade of splenic injury, and operations performed were extracted. Numbers of pediatric surgeons per hospital were obtained. 9567 children were identified. 2.1% underwent a splenectomy and 0.8% underwent a splenorrhaphy. The average surgeon performed 0.6 (SD=0.6) splenectomies and 0.2 (SD=0.4) splenorrhaphies for trauma. If these rates remain constant over time, the average surgeon would perform 1.8 (SD =1.7) splenectomies and 0.6 (SD =1.1) splenorrhaphies for trauma over a 30- year surgical career. Nonoperative management is associated with a host of benefits, but has resulted in a decrease in the experience level of the pediatric surgeons expected to perform an emergency splenectomy or splenorrhaphy when the unusual occasion arises.
