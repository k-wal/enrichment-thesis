27536475|a|There is a paucity of data regarding outcomes for patients undergoing breast augmentation with implants after breast conservation surgery (BCS) and radiotherapy. This retrospective study examined outcomes for patients with breast implant -only augmentation after BCS and radiotherapy. Between June 1998 and December 2010, 671 women underwent prosthetic breast reconstruction. Nineteen patients (2.8%) underwent an augmentation after BCS and radiotherapy. The mean age was 55.8 years (range, 40-69 years). Sixteen of these patients underwent one-stage implant -only breast augmentation, whereas 3 patients underwent two-stage expander and then implant augmentation. All surgeries were successful. The average size of breast implant used was 258.7�€‰g. Seven patients also received contralateral augmentation with an average implant size of 232.2�€‰g. One patient received oral antibiotics for minor wound infection. Patients were judged to have an excellent (14/19; 73.7%), good (3/19; 15.8%), or fair (2/19; 10.5%) cosmetic result. The breasts of selected patients with breast cancer after BCS and radiotherapy. with asymmetry can be adequately augmented with breast implants alone.
