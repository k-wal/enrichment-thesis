27551182|t|Laparascopic Splenectomy Due to Splenic Injury after Colonoscopy
27551182|a|Colonoscopy, which is routinely performed in diagnosis and treatment of colorectal disorders, is a reliable procedure. Its most frequent complications are bleeding and perforation. Splenic rupture is a very rarely met complication of colonoscopy, and delay in its diagnosis leads to increased morbidity and mortality. We presented a 69 years old female patient, who was diagnosed by computerized abdominal tomography, performed for her abdominal pain, which started following the colonoscopy. After 15 days of medical treatment and follow-up, laparoscopic splenectomy was performed one month after her colonoscopy. The patient was discharged on her 4(th) postoperative day, with uneventful recovery. In patients who have complaint of abdominal pain following colonoscopy, an intraabdominal pathological condition should be considered and computerized abdominal tomography should be performed. If there is no detected intraperitoneal bleeding, in other words, if there is a sub-capsular hematoma of the spleen, medical management by monitoring the vital signs may be preferred. Then, splenectomy should be performed at an appropriate time.
