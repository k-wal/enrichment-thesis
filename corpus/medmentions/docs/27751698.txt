27751698|a|Despite being an effective analgesic for children with fractures, some clinicians may avoid prescribing ibuprofen due to its potentially harmful effect on bone healing. To determine if exposure to ibuprofen is associated with an increased risk of bone healing complications in children with fractures. We performed a retrospective study of children aged 6 months to 17 years who presented to the pediatric emergency department (PED) with a fracture of the tibia, femur, humerus, scaphoid, or fifth metatarsus and who followed up with the orthopedic service. We chose these fractures due to their higher risk for complications. We classified patients as exposed if they received ibuprofen in the PED or during hospitalization or were prescribed ibuprofen at discharge. The main outcome was a bone healing complication as evidenced by nonunion, delayed union, or re-displacement on follow-up radiographs. Of the 808 patients included in the final analysis, 338 (42%) were exposed to ibuprofen. Overall, 27 (3%) patients had a bone healing complication; 8 (1%) developed nonunion, 3 (0.4%) developed delayed union, and 16 (2%) developed re-displacement. Ten (3%) patients who were exposed to ibuprofen, and 17 (4%) who were not, developed a bone healing complication (odds ratio 0.8, 95% confidence interval 0.4-1.8; p = 0.61). There was no significant association between ibuprofen exposure and the development of a bone healing complication despite adjustment for potential confounders. Children with extremity fractures who are exposed to ibuprofen do not seem to be at increased risk for clinically important bone healing complications.
