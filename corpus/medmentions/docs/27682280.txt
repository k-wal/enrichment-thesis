27682280|t|Avulsions of Triceps Brachii: associated injuries and surgical treatment; a case series
27682280|a|This study reports the clinical presentations, intra -operative findings, type of the treatments, outcome of the treatment and specially associated injuries in patients with the avulsion of the distal end of the triceps brachii (TB) tendon. We studied 6 patients with rupture or avulsion of the distal end of the TB tendon. The medical records, imaging files, clinical outcomes at the final follow up visit were reviewed. The clinical outcomes were assessed by Mayo Elbow Score at the final follow-up visit. All patients were male, 4 of them having injury in the left hand as the non-dominant hand. Mean age of them was 34.5 years. All cases had small bony fleck in the posterior of elbow in lateral radiograph. Three patients had associated injuries -including intra-articular fractures and medial collateral ligament rupture. In one case V-Y plasty of the distal TB was done. In 4 patients the results of surgery were excellent, one was good and one was fair. Although TB tendon rupture is rare, it should be -considered in differential diagnosis of the upper -extremity trauma and its associated injuries should be addressed properly.
