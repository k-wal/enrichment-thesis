28503431|t|A pilot study of intraocular lens explantation in 69 eyes in Chinese patients
28503431|a|To study the effects of intraocular lens (IOL) explantation and demographic characteristics. Retrospective non-comparative case series. Clinical data recorded from patient charts included the following: demographic, preoperative and postoperative characteristics; complications; surgical methods, and changes in visual acuity. A total of 69 eyes in 67 Chinese patients who received IOL explants were studied. The patients ' mean age at the time of explantation was 46.1 years old [SD 22.5 (6-85)], and 37 patients were female (55.2%). Regarding employment, 47.8% were farmers, 23.9% were retired, 16.4% were students, 4.5% were unemployed, 3% were workers, and 4.5% were other (including staff members, teachers and officers). The main reasons for explantation were dislocation / decentration in 41 cases (59.4%) and retinal detachment in 10 cases (14.5%). The third most prevalent cause was incorrect lens power in 7 eyes (10.1%). The remaining reasons were endophthalmitis in 6 cases (8.7%), posterior capsular opacity in 3 eyes (4.3%), and impacting retinal surgery operation in 2 cases (2.9%). The main comorbidities were high myopia in 18 eyes (26.1%), trauma in 8 eyes (11.6%), retinal detachment in 6 eyes (8.7%), congenital cataracts in 8 eyes (11.6%), and Marfan's syndrome in 2 eyes (2.9%). The mean time from implantation to explantation was 4.0y [SD 4.2 (0.005-15)]. Treatment after explantation included posterior chamber IOL implantation in 44 eyes (63.8%) and aphakia in 25 eyes (36.2%). After surgery, the best corrected visual ability (BCVA) was improved in 50 cases (72.5%), including 28 patients (40.6%) in whom visual ability was improved by more than two lines. Dislocation / decentration is the main cause for explantation, and high myopia is a main risk factor. Posterior chamber IOL implantation remains the most elected treatment after explantation.
