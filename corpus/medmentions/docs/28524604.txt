28524604|t|Prevalence of high fractional exhaled nitric oxide among US youth with asthma
28524604|a|High fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is an indicator of poor asthma control and has been proposed as a non-invasive assessment tool to guide asthma management. We aimed to describe the prevalence of and factors associated with high FeNO among US youth with asthma. Data from 716 children and adolescents with asthma ages 6-19 years who participated in the 2007-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Using American Thoracic Society guidelines, high FeNO was defined as >50 ppb for ages 12-19 years and >35 ppb for ages 6-11 years. Multivariate logistic regression examined associations between high FeNO and age, sex, race / Hispanic origin, income status, weight status, tobacco smoke exposure, and other factors associated with asthma control (recent use of inhaled corticosteroids, recent respiratory illness, asthma -related respiratory signs/symptoms, and spirometry). About 16.5% of youth with asthma had high FeNO. The prevalence of high FeNO was higher among non-Hispanic black (27%, P < 0.001) and Hispanic (20.2%, P = 0.002) youth than non-Hispanic white (9.7%) youth. Differences in high FeNO prevalence by sex (girls < boys), weight status (obese < normal weight), tobacco smoke exposure (smokers < home exposure < no exposure), and FEV1/FVC (normal < abnormal) were also observed. No differences were noted between categories for the remaining covariates. High FeNO was observed to be associated with sex, race / Hispanic origin, weight status, tobacco smoke exposure, and abnormal FEV1/FVC, but was not associated with asthma -related respiratory symptoms. These findings may help inform future research and clinical practice guidelines on the use of high FeNO in the assessment of asthma control.
