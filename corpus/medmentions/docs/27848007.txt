27848007|a|Although rheumatic heart disease is becoming uncommon in industrialized countries, its global burden is still significant. We report the case of a 70-year-old male with rheumatic heart disease, who underwent 4 previous heart valve replacement surgeries, and presented to our hospital with refractory heart failure (NYHA functional class IV) due to severe stenosis of a previously implanted tricuspid bioprosthesis. The Heart Team deemed the patient as inoperable / high-risk for surgery. As an alternative, a transcatheter tricuspid valve-in-valve replacement was decided upon and later executed through the right femoral vein, with the insertion of an Edwards SAPIEN XT 29 no. (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) through the inferior vena cava, towards the RV, followed by direct implantation in the tricuspid bioprosthesis (valve-in-valve), under rapid pacing, without complications. A substantial clinical and echocardiographic improvement was noted after the procedure and the patient was subsequently discharged in NYHA functional class II. These favourable outcomes persisted through the 1-year follow-up period. This case report adds to the current body of evidence that tricuspid valve implantation stands as a viable and reliable alternative in the treatment of degenerated bioprosthesis in high-surgical-risk patients.
