28260464|a|An incisional hernia seriously burdens the quality of life after liver transplant. The incidence of incisional hernia after liver transplant is reported to be 4% to 20%. Here, we evaluated incisional hernias that occurred after adult liver transplant and incisional hernias intentionally made in infant liver transplant procedures. Between December 1988 and May 2016, we performed 536 liver transplant procedures in 515 patients. Demographic features, surgical outcomes, and predisposing factors were evaluated. Of 452 liver transplant patients included, incisional hernias were diagnosed in 29 patients (6.4%; 7 pediatric, 22 adult). Most were males (77%) with Child-Pugh score C cirrhosis (62%), moderate / severe ascites (81%), and serum albumin levels <3.5 g/L (86%). Incisional hernia developed in 16 of 51 patients (31%) with wound infection. Twelve incisional hernias were seen in 40 recipients (30%) with body mass index â‰¥30 kg/m2. Eight of 45 patients (18%) with repeated surgery had incisional hernias. Five of 22 adult incisional hernias (23%) had primary fascia repair, and 17 (77%) were repaired with Prolene mesh graft (3 sublay, 14 onlay). No other complications and no hernia recurrence were shown during follow-up (range, 8-138 mo). Of 7 pediatric liver transplant patients with intentionally made incisional hernias during liver transplant, 5 patients had primary fascia repair and 2 patients had onlay mesh repair. No complications or recurrence were shown during follow-up (range, 12-60 mo). Repeated surgery, postoperative wound infection, and obesity were found to be predisposing risk factors for incisional hernia development after liver transplant in adult s. Abdomen closure in infant liver transplant with large-for-size grafts is a different area of discussion. Here, we suggest that an intentionally made incisional hernia with staged closure of the abdomen is safe and effective for graft and patient survival.
