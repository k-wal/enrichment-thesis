27653736|a|BACKGROUND In healthy individuals, such as liver living donors, potential complications may occur during surgery. Reporting such complications and near-miss events is mandatory to improve living donor management and safety. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study was performed on a prospective database with the aim of providing a brief analysis of the perioperative, medium-term, and long-term complications, and the near-miss events in a single center series of 100 consecutive liver resections for adult -to- adult living-donor liver transplantation. RESULTS Only 23.3% of potential living donors underwent surgery. No living donor mortality was reported; 29 patients (29%) experienced at least one complication. Five patients developed mild long-term dysfunction; two aborted hepatectomies, and there were two near-miss events reported. CONCLUSIONS A strategy for an accurate assessment of living donor complications and strict selection criterion cannot be overemphasized, as well as the need to continuously update center patient outcome reports.
