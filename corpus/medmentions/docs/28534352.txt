28534352|a|The purpose of this analysis was to assess the tumor response and long-term outcome in patients treated with preoperative radiotherapy (PRT) without systemic therapy. Between 1997 and 2000, 134 patients with non-inflammatory locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) were treated with PRT. The tumor dose was 45 Gy in 15 fractions to the breast and to regional lymph nodes over 6 weeks. Radical mastectomy was performed 6 weeks after PRT to all patients and adjuvant systemic therapy was administered as per protocol. The measures of disease outcome were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) which estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median follow-up was 74 months (range 4-216). Objective clinical tumor response after PRT was observed in 77.6% of the patients. Clinical complete tumor response (cCR) was achieved in 21.6% of the patients. Pathological CR in the breast was achieved in 15% of the patients. The 5- and 10- year OS were 55.1 and 37.8%, respectively. The 5- and 10- year DFS were 39.2 and 27%, respectively. Patients who achieved cCR had significantly longer OS in comparison with patients achieving clinical partial response (cPR) and clinical stable disease (cSD). Similarly, DFS of patients in the cCR group was longer compared with patients with cPR and cSD, yet without statistical significance. Our results showed that local control in LABC patients achieved by primary PRT, followed by radical mastectomy was comparable with the results reported in the literature. Complete pathologic response to PRT identified a subgroup of patients with a trend toward better DFS and OS.
