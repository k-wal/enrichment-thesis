27459296|a|The purpose of this study was to describe the results and complications of primary site salvage surgery after head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with bioradiotherapy. We conducted a retrospective chart review of 268 patients treated with bioradiotherapy between March 2006 and December 2013 at the Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge-ICO. Fifty-nine patients developed local recurrence or had residual disease with a 1- year and 3- year overall survival of 47% and 15.4%, respectively. Salvage surgery was feasible in 22 patients (37.3%). There were 16 complications in these 22 patients (72.7%), 11 (50%) of which were major. Bilateral neck dissection was identified as a risk factor for complications. Salvage surgery after bioradiotherapy is associated with a high rate of complications. Neck dissection seems to be related to an increased rate of complications with no survival improvement.
