28481004|t|Tips and Pitfalls in Direct Ligation of Large Spontaneous Splenorenal Shunt during Liver Transplantation
28481004|a|Patients with large spontaneous splenorenal shunt (SRS) prove challenging during liver transplantation (LT), irrespective of organizing portal vein (PV) thrombosis. Here, we detail the clinical outcomes of 26 patients who underwent direct ligation of large SRS during LT. Direct ligation of large SRS was applied in poor portal flow during LT. We performed temporary test clamping of the SRS before direct ligation and applied PV pressure monitoring in patients who showed signs of portal hypertension, such as bowel edema. We retrospectively reviewed and evaluated their clinical outcomes. Among 843 patients who underwent LT between 2010 and 2015, 26 (3.9%) underwent direct ligation of SRS without any intraoperative event. Mean preoperative MELD score was 16.7±9.0. The main PV diameter on preoperative computed tomography was 8.3±3.4 mm (range, 3.0-14.0 mm). SRS was easily identified at just below the distal pancreas and beside the inferior mesenteric vein in all patients. Accompanying PV thrombectomy was done in 42.3% of patients. Among 26 patients, massive and prolonged ascites was evident in 15.4% (n = 4) postoperatively. They were all living donor LT recipients with a small PV diameter (4.0-6.7 mm). Except for one patient who underwent splenic artery embolization, ascites was tolerable and well controlled by conservative management. There was a 7.7% rate of major complications related to direct ligation, including reoperation due to combined ligation of SRS along with a left renal vein at the confluence. Except for one hospital mortality due to sepsis, 25 patients (96.2%) are alive with no evidence of further PV complications. In conclusion, direct ligation of large SRS during LT is a safe and feasible method to overcome the effects of a large SRS. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
