28427655|a|Effect of ultrasound and enzymatic pre-treatments with cellulase and pectinase on yield and properties of banana juice were investigated. A two-level full factorial design was employed. The factors selected were ultrasonication time (0 and 30 min), cellulase concentration (0 and 0.2%) and pectinase concentration (0 and 0.2%). The responses studied were yield, viscosity, clarity, total soluble solids (TSS) and pH. It was observed that pectinase was more effective in increasing the yield of juice compared to cellulase. Ultrasonic pre-treatment alone did not significantly increase the yield of juice. When ultrasound was combined with pre-treatment with both the enzymes maximum yield of 89.40% was obtained compared to 47.30% in the control. The viscosity of the juice decreased with addition of enzymes and with application of ultrasound. The clarity of the juice was not affected by cellulase treatment, but improved with pectinase treatment. Ultrasonication alone was found to be more effective than pectinase or cellulase treatment in improving the clarity of the juice. The TSS increased with enzymatic treatment, ultrasonication and their combination. pH was not affected by treatment type, but was found to be lower for the treated juices. Significant correlations were observed between the various responses.
