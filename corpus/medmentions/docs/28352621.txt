28352621|t|Granulomatous prostatitis: clinical and histomorphologic survey of the disease in a tertiary care hospital
28352621|a|Granulomatous prostatitis is an uncommon entity that is diagnosed incidentally on histopathology and is broadly classified as nonspecific, specific, postsurgical (post-transurethral resection), or secondary to other rare systemic granulomatous diseases. Only very few studies are available in the literature that describe the clinical and histomorphological spectrum of the disease. A retrospective analysis of histopathological records of 1,181 prostatic specimens received in the pathology department was done over a period of 13 years (January 2003 to January 2016). All histologically proven cases of granulomatous prostatitis were retrieved, and relevant clinical data were collected from patients' records. Epstein and Hutchins classification was used to categorize these cases. Twenty-two cases of granulomatous prostatitis were identified, accounting for an incidence of 1.86%. Among these, nonspecific granulomatous prostatitis (n = 10) was the most common followed by tubercular prostatitis (n = 5), posttransurethral resection of the prostate (n = 3), allergic (n = 2), and xanthogranulomatous prostatitis (n = 2). The age range of these patients was between 41 and 75 years, with the majority of patients in their 7(th) decade. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels ranged between 0.88 ng/mL and 19.22 ng/mL. Hard and fixed nodules were observed on digital rectal examination in 14 cases. Transrectal ultrasound revealed hypoechoic shadows in five cases. Despite present-day advances in imaging modalities and serological investigations, it is virtually impossible to identify granulomatous prostatitis clinically. Histopathology remains the gold standard in diagnosing the disease. However, assigning an etiologic cause to the wide spectrum of granulomas in granulomatous prostatitis requires a pathologist's expertise and proper clinical correlation for appropriate patient management.
