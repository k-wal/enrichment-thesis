27528862|t|A proteomic evaluation of urinary changes associated with cardiopulmonary bypass
27528862|a|The urinary proteome of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may provide important insights into systemic and renal changes associated with the procedure. Such information may ultimately provide a basis to differentiate changes or properties associated with the development of acute kidney injury. While mass spectrometry (MS) analysis offers the potential for in-depth compositional analysis it is often limited in coverage and relative quantitation capacity. The aim of this study was to develop a process flow for the preparation and comparison of the intraoperative urinary proteome. Urines were collected from patients at the start of CPB and 1-h into CPB. Pooled samples (n = 5) from each time point were processed using a modified Filter Assisted Sample Preparation protocol. The resulting peptides were analyzed by 2D-LC-MS / MS and by 1D-LC-MS / MS SWATH (Sequential Window acquisition of All Theoretical fragment ion spectra). The 2D-LC-MS / MS analysis identified 1324 proteins in the two pools, of which 744 were quantifiable. The SWATH approach provided quantitation for 730 proteins, 552 of which overlapped with the common population from the 2D-IDA results. Intensity correlation filtering between the two methods gave 475 proteins for biological interpretation. Proteins displaying greater than threefold changes (>log2 1.59) at 1-hour CPB relative to the initiation of CPB (26 down-regulated and 22 up-regulated) were selected for further analysis. Up-regulated proteins were enriched in GO terms related to humoral immune response, predominantly innate immunity (C4b, lactotransferrin, protein S100-A8, cathelicidin, myeloperoxidase) and extracellular matrix reorganization (e.g. MMP-9). This study describes a scheme for processing urine from patients undergoing CPB for mass spectrometry -based analysis. The introduction of SWATH into the workflow offers a sample and instrument sparing approach to obtaining consistent in-depth sample analysis. The design of the methodology is such that it can be readily applied to large numbers of clinical samples with the potential for automation. The results also suggest that activation of the innate immune responses occur during cardiac bypass surgery.
