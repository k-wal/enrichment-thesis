28469905|t|SWITCH: Al Wakra Hospital Journey to 90% Hand Hygiene Practice Compliance, 2011 - 2015
28469905|a|Hand Hygiene is the cheapest and simplest way to prevent the spread of infection, however international compliance is below than 40% (WHO, 2009). In the experience of Al Wakra Hospital, the improvement in hand hygiene compliance highlighted not just interventions towards training and education but also behavioral motivation and physical allocations of hand hygiene appliances and equipment. Through motivating the behavioral, emotional, physical and intellectual dimensions of the different healthcare worker professions, hand hygiene compliance has increased from 60.78% in 2011 to 94.14% by the end of December 2015. It took 25 months of continuous and collaborative work with different healthcare workers to reach the 90% hand hygiene target. " Together, we have reached our goals and together we fight against infections ! Because we always strive for excellence in everything we do - that is our vision here in Al Wakra Hospital ."
