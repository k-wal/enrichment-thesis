28231967|t|Rare Pedal Manifestation of Diffuse Multiple Myeloma Lesions
28231967|a|Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cell proliferation leading to production of monoclonal immunoglobins. Among the classic features of multiple myeloma are bone lesions, which typically manifest in the axial skeleton, vertebrae, pelvis, skull, ribs, and proximal extremities. The several types of multiple myeloma include symptomatic multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering / indolent myeloma, and solitary plasmacytoma of bone. Although rare, plasmacytomas of the foot and ankle have been described in published studies. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first description of classic diffuse myelomatosis lesions associated with symptomatic myeloma in the foot of a patient with advanced disease who was treated in the podiatric surgery clinic for pathologic fracture.
