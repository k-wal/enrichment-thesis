28438542|t|Identification of low micromolar dual inhibitors for aldose reductase (ALR2) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) using structure based design approach
28438542|a|Clinical studies have revealed that diabetic retinopathy is a multifactorial disorder. Moreover, studies also suggest that ALR2 and PARP-1 co-occur in retinal cells, making them appropriate targets for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. To find the dual inhibitors of ALR2 and PARP-1, the structure based design was carried out in parallel for both the target proteins. A series of novel thiazolidine-2,4-dione (TZD) derivatives were therefore rationally designed, synthesized and their in vitro inhibitory activities against ALR2 and PARP-1 were evaluated. The experimental results showed that compounds 5b and 5f, with 2-chloro and 4-fluoro substitutions, showed biochemical activities in micromolar and submicromolar range (IC50 1.34-5.03Î¼M) against both the targeted enzymes. The structure-activity relationship elucidated for these novel inhibitors against both the enzymes provide new insight into the binding mode of the inhibitors to the active sites of enzymes. The positive results of the biochemical assay suggest that these compounds may be further optimized and utilized for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy.
