27896851|a|A new electro-mechanical device for measuring the lateral stiffness of the skin is now available. It basically allows to recording the forces that the skin opposes to a lateral displacement (1-2 mm) of a pinching type movement. Preliminary assays of this device to various skin sites and an artificial substrate aimed at defining its major characteristics (sensitivity, reproducibility, variations according to skin site). The calibration of the device (Khelometer(®)) and assessment of its reproducibility were carried out through the use of elastometer substrates of various stiffness's. The device was then used, in vivo, at different skin sites (scalp, inner and outer forearms, cheeks) of 213 healthy Japanese women of various ages. The short-time effect of a hydrating regimen (7% glycerol) was recorded on the outer forearm. This new device offers an appreciable reproducibility in vitro and in vivo (coefficient of variation of 2-4% and 5-14%, respectively). Unlike other biophysical methods, the Khelometer(®) can be easily applied onto the human scalp that shows a higher stiffness than the two other skin sites, increasing with age and presence of alopecia. In all the three studied skin sites, the impact of age leads to significantly higher lateral skin stiffness (LSS, expressed as N/mm) values. The latter were found significantly different between the two sides of the forearms where the outer (sun-exposed) side showed statistically slightly higher LSS, than the unexposed inner side. LSS values found on cheeks (≈0.5 N/mm) were about four times lower than those of the scalp (≈2 N/mm) and about half those of forearms (≈1 N/mm). The effect of a 7% glycerol based formula was recorded 20 min post application onto the forearm, leading to a slight drop in LSS (approx. 15%) as compared to a vehicle-applied skin site. These preliminary studies clearly indicate that this new device, applicable to any skin site, offers appreciable assets such as sensitivity and reproducibility. Accordingly, it appears as a new approach in the non-invasive biophysical measurements of the skin surface, in both advanced and applied research investigations.
