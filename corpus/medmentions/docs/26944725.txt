26944725|a|Thanks to widespread diffusion of minimally invasive approach in the setting of both colorectal and hepatic surgeries, the interest in combined resections for colorectal cancer and synchronous liver metastases (SCLM) by totally laparoscopic approach (TLA) has increased. Aim of this study was to compare outcome of combined resections for SCLM performed by TLA or by open approach, in a propensity-score-based study. All 25 patients undergoing combined TLA for SCLM at San Raffaele Hospital in Milano were compared in a case-matched analysis with 25 out of 91 patients undergoing totally open approach (TOA group). Groups were matched with 1:2 ratio using propensity scores based on covariates representing disease severity. Main endpoints were postoperative morbidity and long-term outcome. The Modified Accordion Severity Grading System was used to quantify complications. The groups resulted comparable in terms of patients and disease characteristics. The TLA group, as compared to the TOA group, had lower blood loss (350 vs 600 mL), shorter postoperative stay (9 vs 12 days), lower postoperative morbidity index (0.14 vs 0.20) and severity score for complicated patients (0.60 vs 0.85). Colonic anastomosis leakage had the highest fractional complication burden in both groups. In spite of comparable long-term overall survival, the TLA group had better recurrence-free survival. TLA for combined resections is feasible, and its indications can be widened to encompass a larger population of patients, provided its benefits in terms of reduced overall risk and severity of complications, rapid functional recovery and favorable long-term outcomes.
