28408329|t|Highest dominant frequency and rotor positions are robust markers of driver location during noninvasive mapping of atrial fibrillation: A computational study
28408329|a|Dominant frequency (DF) and rotor mapping have been proposed as noninvasive techniques to guide localization of drivers maintaining atrial fibrillation (AF). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the robustness of both techniques in identifying atrial drivers noninvasively under the effect of electrical noise or model uncertainties. Inverse - computed DFs and phase maps were obtained from 30 different mathematical AF simulations. Epicardial highest dominant frequency (HDF) regions and rotor location were compared with the same inverse - computed measurements after addition of noise to the ECG, size variations of the atria, and linear or angular deviations in the atrial location inside the thorax. Inverse - computed electrograms (EGMs) individually correlated poorly with the original EGMs in the absence of induced uncertainties (0.45 ± 0.12) and were worse with 10-dB noise (0.22 ± 0.11), 3-cm displacement (0.01 ± 0.02), or 36° rotation (0.02 ± 0.03). However, inverse - computed HDF regions showed robustness against induced uncertainties: from 82% ± 18% match for the best conditions, down to 73% ± 23% for 10-dB noise, 77% ± 21% for 5-cm displacement, and 60% ± 22% for 36° rotation. The distance from the inverse - computed rotor to the original rotor was also affected by uncertainties: 0.8 ± 1.61 cm for the best conditions, 2.4 ± 3.6 cm for 10-dB noise, 4.3 ± 3.2 cm for 4-cm displacement, and 4.0 ± 2.1 cm for 36° rotation. Restriction of rotor detections to the HDF area increased rotor detection accuracy from 4.5 ± 4.5 cm to 3.2 ± 3.1 cm (P <.05) with 0-dB noise. The combination of frequency and phase- derived measurements increases the accuracy of noninvasive localization of atrial rotors driving AF in the presence of noise and uncertainties in atrial location or size.
