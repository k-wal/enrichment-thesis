28540341|t|Reflections on Hip Fracture Recovery From Older Adults Enrolled in a Clinical Trial
28540341|a|This study describes patients' perspectives on recovery during participation in a randomized controlled trial that tested a postoperative hip fracture management program (B4 Clinic), compared with usual care, on mobility. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with 50 older adults with hip fracture (from both groups) twice over 12 months. A total of 32 women (64%) and 18 men (36%) participated in the study with a mean age at baseline of 82 (range = 65-98) years. A total of 40 participants reported recovery goals at some point during their recovery from hip fracture but only 18 participants realized their goals within 12 months. Recovering mobility, returning to prefracture activities, and obtaining stable health were the most commonly reported goals. Participants described good social support, access to physiotherapy, and positive perspective as most important to recovery. These factors were influenced by participants ' knowledge, resources, and monthly contact with study staff (perceived as a form of social support). The most frequently reported barriers to participants ' recovery were the onset of complications, pain, and limited access to physiotherapy. Potential implications of these findings include design and modification of new or preexisting fracture programs, prioritizing patient engagement and enhanced knowledge for future clinical research in hip fracture recovery.
