28536123|t|Randomized Controlled Trial of Mineralocorticoid Receptor Blockade in Children with Chronic Kidney Allograft Nephropathy
28536123|a|We showed that mineralocorticoid receptor blockade (MRB) prevented acute and chronic cyclosporine nephropathy (CsA-Nx) in the rat. The aim of this translational study was to investigate the effect of long-term eplerenone administration on renal allograft function in children with biopsy -proven chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). Renal transplant children <18 years, biopsy -proven CAN, and a GFR >40 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were included. Patients with BK virus active nephritis, recurrence of renal disease, GFR decline in previous 3 months, or treated with calcium antagonists or antifungal drugs were excluded. They were randomized to receive placebo (n=10) or eplerenone 25 mg/d for 24 months (n=13). Visits were scheduled at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months. At each period, a complete clinical examination was performed and blood and urine samples were taken. Urine creatinine, 8-hydroxylated-guanosine, heat shock protein 72 (HSP72), and kidney injury molecule (KIM-1) levels were also assessed. In kidney biopsy samples, the tubulo-interstitial area affected by fibrosis (TIF) and glomerulosclerosis were measured at baseline and after 24 months. The baseline eGFR was 80±6 in the placebo and 86±6 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in the eplerenone group; at 24 months it was 66±8 and 81±7 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), respectively (P=0.33; 95% confidence intervals, -18 to 33 at baseline, and -11 to 40 after 24 months). The albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 110±74 in the placebo, and 265±140 mg/g in the eplerenone group; and after 24 months it was 276±140 and 228±88 mg/g, respectively (P=0.15; 95% confidence intervals, -283 to 593, and -485 to 391, respectively). In addition, the placebo exhibited a greater TIF, glomerulosclerosis, and urinary HSP72 compared with the eplerenone group. Although this study was underpowered to provide definitive evidence that long-term eplerenone administration attenuates the progression of CAN in pediatric transplant patients, it encourages testing the potential benefit of MRB in this pediatric population.
