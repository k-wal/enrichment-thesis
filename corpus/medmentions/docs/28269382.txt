28269382|t|Preliminary investigation of energy comparation between gyroscope, electromyography and VO2 wearable sensors
28269382|a|Building on previous experiments in the domain of energy expenditure estimation using wearable sensors, the measurements of energy ratios of a runner on a treadmill were analyzed to observe any commonalities between an inertia measurement unit and an electromyograph sensor. The subjects were equipped with a VO2 gas measurement device, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measuring gyroscopic activity and an electromyography (EMG) sensor network whilst running at 5 different speeds on a calibrated treadmill. The observed results established a co-linear relationship with the gyroscope based measurements, EMG based measurements with the VO2 measurements.
