27899941|t|Influence of increased epicardial adipose tissue volume on 1-year in-stent restenosis in patients who received coronary stent implantation
27899941|a|Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is significantly associated with the formation and composition of coronary atherosclerotic plaque, cardiac events and the clinical prognosis of coronary heart disease. But, whether increased EAT deposition may affect the incidence of in-stent restenosis (ISR) is currently unclear. This study used coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as a mean to investigate whether increased EAT volume was associated with ISR. A total of 364 patients who underwent 64-slice CCTA examination for the evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease, and subsequently underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the first time, and then accepted coronary angiography (CA) follow-up for ISR examination in one year, were retrospectively included in this study. EAT volume was measured by CCTA examination. CA follow-up was obtained between 9 and 15 months. ISR was deﬁned as ≥ 50% luminal diameter narrowing of the stent segment or peri-stent segment. EAT volume was compared between patients with and without ISR and additional well-known predictors of ISR were compared. EAT volume was signiﬁcantly increased in patients with ISR compared with those without ISR (154.5 ± 74.6 mL vs. 131.0 ± 52.2 mL, P < 0.001). The relation between ISR and EAT volume remained signiﬁcant after adjustment for conventional cardiovascular risk factors and angiographic parameters. EAT volume was related with ISR and may provide additional information for future ISR.
