28284237|t|Interpreting Pain Symptoms and How Pain Affects Neuromuscular Control in Dancers If I'm in Pain, How Should I Train?
28284237|a|This review draws from leading research on pain neuroscience and control of posture and movement to help inform rehabilitation approaches and when it may or may not be prudent to " dance through" pain. Control of posture and movement is frequently distorted by pain perception, and that may not be altered even when the pain is resolved. It is important to exclude serious systemic disease or major tissue injury with severe, unremitting, or persistent symptoms before focusing on movement -based rehabilitation. Both specific exercises (contraction of specific muscles and use of movement techniques) and general exercises (which promote strength, power, endurance, and flexibility) can help to manage individuals with persistent pain problems. Training control of posture and movement can improve motor skills and tissue integrity and also normalize perception of sensory stimuli from the peripheral nervous system in the brain. A framework for planning such training can be considered in terms of progression of load, complexity, and context.
