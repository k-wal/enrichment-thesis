28034384|t|Mesenteric lipoblastoma presenting as a small intestinal volvulus in an infant: A case report and literature review
28034384|a|A 1-year-old boy with no underlying disorder presented with non-bilious vomiting since 4 days before admission. He was referred to our hospital and was diagnosed with a small bowel obstruction due to an intraabdominal tumor. Laparotomy revealed an intestinal volvulus with a soft and lobulated tumor arising from the mesentery. The resected tumor with a small part of the small bowel was diagnosed as lipoblastoma histologically. From a literature review, mesenteric lipoblastoma with an intestinal volvulus showed different characteristics such as greater frequency of vomiting and less frequency of abdominal mass as clinical symptoms, and the size of the tumor was smaller than that of the tumor without the intestinal volvulus.
