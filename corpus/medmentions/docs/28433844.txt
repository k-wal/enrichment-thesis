28433844|t|Neurological Decline in an Elderly with Repaired Myelomeningocele Complicated with Lumbar Canal Stenosis: a case report
28433844|a|Tethered cord syndrome is a well-known complication after myelomeningocele (MMC) repair in childhood. However, late complications in adults with a repaired MMC are not well understood. In particular, the influence of a degenerative spinal deformity on a sustained tethered cord is still unclear. A 63-year-old man with a repaired MMC presented with a progressive gait disturbance and numbness in both lower limbs. Magnetic resonance images demonstrated that the tethered spinal cord was compressed by severe canal stenosis along the entire lumbar spine. After a multi-level lumbar decompression surgery, the patient recovered to baseline neurological status. In adults with a repaired MMC, lumbar canal stenosis should be investigated as a possible cause of late neurological decline. Clinical manifestations may be complicated by the coexistence of both the original and subsequent neurological disorders. Because these additional disorders result from compressive myelopathy, early surgical decompression is indicated to avoid irreversible spinal cord dysfunction.
