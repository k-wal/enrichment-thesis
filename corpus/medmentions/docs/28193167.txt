28193167|a|Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection is present in about 50% of the global population, and is associated with chronic gastritis, peptic disease and gastric malignancies. HP prevalence in Crohn's disease (CD) patients was shown to be low compared to the general population, and its influence on disease activity is yet to be determined. Our aims were to determine the prevalence of HP in a selected group of CD patients with quiescent disease, and to assess the influence of its eradication on disease activity and endoscopic and laboratory activity measures. Consecutive CD patients with quiescent disease underwent meticulous disease evaluation with MR enterography (MRE), video capsule endoscopy (VCE), CRP, fecal calprotectin and CDAI. All patients were tested for the presence of HP using stool antigen detection kit. Patients infected with HP were offered eradication treatment with sequential therapy. HP eradication was confirmed using urease breath test and stool antigen test. The influence of HP eradication on disease activity was assessed. Out of 56 patients enrolled, six patients (10.7%) had HP infection. Of them, five patients had gastro- duodenitis per VCE. All HP positive patients were offered eradication treatment and underwent successful eradication. Notably, 23 (50%) of patients had proximal disease per VCE, most of them (78%) were HP negative. CDAI, CRP, fecal calprotectin and VCE Lewis inflammatory score did not change significantly following HP eradication, Gastric findings on VCE were not impacted by HP eradication. The prevalence of HP infection in patients with quiescent CD is relatively low. Eradication of the bacteria did not significantly change neither disease activity measures nor the presence of gastro- duodenitis per VCE, suggesting it might be part of proximal CD. The influence of HP on CD activity merits further investigation.
