28545365|t|Role of infrared spectroscopy and imaging in cancer diagnosis
28545365|a|FTIR imaging has been used to diagnose and differentiate the molecular differences between normal and diseased tissues. The differences correspond to the distribution and structure of lipids, proteins, nucleic acids as well as other metabolites. These differences depended on the type and the grade of cancer. The sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs on individual specific was also discussed. Here, we emphasize that FTIR spectroscopy and imaging can be considered as a promising technique and will find its place on the detection of this dreadful disease because of high sensitivity, accuracy and inexpensive technique. Now the medical community started using and accepting this technique for early stage cancer detection. But, this technique endures several challenges on its application into the diagnosis of cancer in regards of sample preparations, data interpretation, and data analysis. In general, more research is needed in this field and it is necessary to understand the morphology and biology of the sample before using the spectroscopy and imaging because invaluable information to be figured out.
