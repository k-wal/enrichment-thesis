28436286|t|Coordinated Asthma Program Improves Asthma Outcomes in High-Risk Children
28436286|a|Innovative approaches within primary care are needed to reduce fragmented care, increase continuity of care, and improve asthma outcomes in children with asthma. Our objective was to assess the impact of coordinated team -based asthma care on unplanned asthma -related health care utilization. A multidisciplinary asthma team was developed to provide coordinated care to high-risk asthma patients. Patients received an in-depth diagnostic and family needs assessment, asthma education, and coordinated referral to social and community services. Over a 2- year period, 141 patients were followed. At both 1 and 2 years postintervention, there was a significant decrease from preintervention rates in urgent care visits (40%, P = .002; 50%, P < .0001), emergency department visits (63%, P < .0001; 70%, P < .0001), and inpatient hospitalization (69%, P = .002; 54%, P = .04). Our coordinated asthma care program was associated with a reduction in urgent care visits, emergency department visits, and inpatient hospitalizations among high-risk children with asthma.
