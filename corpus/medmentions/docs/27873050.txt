27873050|a|Regression of meningioma after haemorrhage and the cessation of hormone treatment is well reported. However, spontaneous regression is very rarely observed. Here, we report the spontaneous regression of a parafalcine meningioma in a 56- year -old woman with multiple sclerosis, who was referred to our department after an incidental finding on magnetic resonance imaging. She was being treated with interferon beta-1a to manage the symptoms. To our knowledge, this is the first report of spontaneous regression of meningioma in a patient receiving interferon beta-1a therapy and just the second report of spontaneous regression in general.
