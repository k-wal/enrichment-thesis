27975020|t|Divided and Sliding Superficial Temporal Artery Flap for Primary Donor-site Closure
27975020|a|Superficial temporal artery (STA) flaps are often used for reconstruction of hair-bearing areas. However, primary closure of the donor site is not easy when the size of the necessary skin island is relatively large. In such cases, skin grafts are needed at the donor site, resulting in baldness. We have solved this issue by applying the divided and sliding flap technique, which was first reported for primary donor-site closure of a latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap. We applied this technique to the hair-bearing STA flap, where primary donor-site closure is extremely beneficial for preventing baldness consequent to skin grafting. The STA flap was divided into 3, and creation of large flap was possible. Therefore, we concluded that the divided and sliding STA flap could at least partially solve the donor-site problem. Although further investigation is necessary to validate the maximum possible flap size, this technique may be applicable to at least small defects that are common after skin cancer ablation or trauma.
