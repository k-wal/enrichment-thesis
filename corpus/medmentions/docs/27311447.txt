27311447|t|Benefit and risk in short term after total hip arthroplasty by direct anterior approach combined with dual mobility cup
27311447|a|No previous reports have described the benefits and risks associated with the dual mobility cup (DMC) in primary THA via direct anterior approach (DAA). The aim of this study was to compare the safety and rate of early postoperative complication of the DAA with the DMC for THA with those of the DAA with a single standard cup, and to investigate the influence of the learning curve of the use of DMC on intra - and perioperative outcomes. We retrospectively investigated 60 hips treated in the single- DAA group and 60 hips treated in the dual- DAA group. A primary / secondary outcome variable was the presence of any intra - or perioperative complication within the first 6 months /the operative time and hip function at 6 months postoperatively. We also analyzed influence of the learning curve of the use of DMC on intra - and perioperative outcomes. No intraoperative complications were observed in either group. One anterior dislocation and one periprosthetic hip fracture were occurred in the single- DAA group. The surgical times in the single- DAA and dual- DAA groups were 112.0 ± 20.9 and 121.0 ± 26.9 min (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the 6- month postoperative hip function scores between the two groups. There was no influence of the learning curve of the use of DMC on intra - and perioperative outcomes. We have demonstrated the short-term safety and lack of inferiority of using the DMC in the DAA compared with the standard single mobility cup.
