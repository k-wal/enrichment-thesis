28123242|a|Cells with stem cell like properties in solid organ malignancies like breast and pancreas have been studied over the last decade and have been found to be associated with poor prognosis. Presence of CD44 positive and CD24 negative tumor cells in breast carcinoma (cells with ' stem cell ' like property) as marker of aggressiveness and poor prognosis was checked for association with various markers of disease aggression like age at presentation, size of tumor, histological grade of tumor, triple negative status, level of micro-vessel density, and nodal status. Single and double staining immunohistochemistry protocol was used for CD24 and CD44 staining. The staining protocol was repeated with more contemporary techniques using fluorescent chromogen also. 52 cases, all females who underwent modified radical mastectomy at a tertiary care hospital over a period of 3 years, were evaluated. No association was found between presence of stem cells and size of lesion, histological grade, triple negative status or micro-vessel density. However, significant association was found with respect to younger age of presentation (p value = 0.044). 20 out of 25 cases with nodal metastasis were positive for presence of stem cells (p value is 0.0003). Further, 18 of these 20 cases also had stem cells in the metastatic nodule. Fluorescent chromogens (FITC and Cyanine Red) revealed similar results. Cases positive for stem cells showed earlier onset of disease and proneness to nodal metastasis.
