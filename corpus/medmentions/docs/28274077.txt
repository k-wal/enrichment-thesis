28274077|t|Palliative Care with Attachment Hybrid Removable Prosthesis
28274077|a|Abutment injury, unsatisfactory aesthetics and lesser retention exist with the cast partial denture. Though these constraints exist in the Removable Partial Denture (RPD) it is still widely used because of the simplicity in design, fabrication, economics and patient comfort. This clinical report describes a hybrid RPD technique which uses extra coronal attachment that reduces the limitations and provides better comfort for the patient.
