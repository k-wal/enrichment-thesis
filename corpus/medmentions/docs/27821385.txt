27821385|t|Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy in Breast Cancer: A Novel e-Health Approach in Optimizing Treatment for Seniors (OPTIMUM): A Two- Group Controlled Comparison Pilot Study
27821385|a|In women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer, adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) is associated with a significant survival advantage. Nonadherence is a particular challenge in older women, even though they stand to benefit the most from AET. Therefore, a novel eHealth tool (OPTIMUM) that integrates real-time analysis of health administrative claims data was developed to provide point-of-care decision support for clinicians. The objectives of the study are to determine the effectiveness of a patient -specific, real-time eHealth alert delivered at point-of-care in reducing rates of AET discontinuation and to understand patient -level factors related to AET discontinuation as well as to assess integration of eHealth alerts regarding deviations from best practices in administration of AET by cancer care teams. A prospective, 2- group controlled comparison pilot study will be conducted at 2 urban, McGill University-affiliated hospitals, the Royal Victoria Hospital and St. Mary's Hospital. A minimum of 43 patients per study arm will be enrolled through site-level allocation. Follow-up is 1.5 years. Health care professionals at the intervention site will have access to the eHealth tool, which will report to them in real-time medical events with known associations to AET discontinuation, an AET adherence monitor, and a discontinuation alert. Cox proportional hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals will estimate risks of AET discontinuation. Tests for significance will be 2-sided with a significance level of P<.05. This protocol has been approved and funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. The study will evaluate site-level differences between AET discontinuation and AET adherence and assess care team actions at the intervention site. Participant enrollment into this project is expected to start September 2016 with primary data ready to present by June 2018. This study will offer an opportunity to verify the feasibility of integrating an eHealth tool that aims to improve the long-term management of breast cancer in a high-risk population by allowing more timely intervention to prevent or rapidly address AET discontinuation.
