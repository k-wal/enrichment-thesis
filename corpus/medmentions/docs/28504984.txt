28504984|t|Melding a High-Risk Patient for Continuous Flow Left Ventricular Assist Device into a Low-Risk Patient
28504984|a|The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) has been used as a predictor of mortality after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement. However, improvement or worsening of MELD and how those changes affect outcomes is unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of 244 patients implanted with a continuous flow (CF) LVAD. Patients were dichotomized at admission into low - or high-risk categories using a cutoff of MELD â‰¥ 19, and they were reclassified at day of implant forming four groups: Group LL (remained low risk), LH (worsened to high risk), HH (remained high risk), and HL (improved to low risk). Patients who improved to a low risk (group HL) had the same 1 year survival as those that remained low risk (group LL; 80% vs. 77%; p = 0.6). However, patients who were initially classified as low risk and worsened to a high risk (group LH) had a survival that was worse than those that were consistently high risk (group HH; 55% vs. 10%; p = 0.01). Model for end-stage liver disease reclassification after adjusting for commonly attributed risk factors remained an independent predictor for mortality, including patients classified as Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) 1 and 2. In conclusion, our MELD score reclassification is an independent and powerful predictor of mortality in patients undergoing LVAD implantation.
