28465502|t|Outcome of obese and diabetic patients underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass: when the surgery fails
28465502|a|The beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on diabetes and obesity have been widely demonstrated in literature. The aim of our study was to evaluate the rate of failure of laparoscopic gastric bypass both in terms of weight loss and metabolic remission after one follow-up year. A longitudinal, multicentric prospective study was carried out on 771 patients affected by pathological obesity. The following parameters were recorded for each patient before surgery: anthropometric, metabolic, social, smoking habits and previous failure of other bariatric procedures. After 1 follow-up year, final weight, final BMI, final percentage of lost excess body weight and percentage of lost BMI were evaluated. Statistical analysis showed a correlation between BMI > 50 Kg/m2, presence of metabolic syndrome, presence of diabetes, gastric pouch volume greater than 60 ml and failure of weight loss outcome. Statistical analysis of metabolic failure has recognized a high preoperative HbA1c % value as a statistically significant negative predictive factor. Bariatric Surgery is the most effective treatment for weight loss and metabolic improvement. However, in our study, surgery did not achieve the expected outcome in patients with specific metabolic, anthropometric and surgical characteristics (BMI > 50 Kg/m2, presence of metabolic syndrome, presence of T2DM with high preoperative HbA1c % level and gastric pouch volume greater than 60 ml).
