27479867|a|Subepidermal calcified nodule of the eyelid is considered as one of the types of calcinosis cutis. It generally occurs in children, and is not known to be associated with systemic disease. The authors report histopathological and clinical findings in 14 cases of subepidermal calcified nodule of the eyelid, including 3 older patients with unique microscopic features. Clinical records and pathological materials were critically reviewed in each case, including von kossa, CD3, CD20, and CD68 stains. The 14 cases presented clinically as nodular eyelid lesions. All were treated with surgical excision. The authors found 2 distinct histopathological patterns which correlated with the patients ' age. In young patients, the authors observed multiple, small calcified bodies within the dermis surrounded by chronic inflammation and granulomatous foreign body reaction. On the other hand, in elderly patients, lesions were characterized by a single, large, well-demarcated amorphous calcified deposit surrounded by fibrous tissue, without chronic inflammation or foreign body reaction. One of these patients, a 70- year-old man, also suffered from gout. The presence of subepidermal calcified nodule was not documented as a preoperative diagnostic possibility in any of the cases. Subepidermal calcified nodule of the eyelid is a rare condition, but should be considered in any patient presenting with a painless white to yellowish colored nodule of the ocular adnexa, particularly during the teenage years. Clinicians and pathologists should be aware that this entity has a distinct appearance and could be associated with systemic conditions in elderly patients.
