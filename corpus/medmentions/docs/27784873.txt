27784873|a|Overactive bladder is one of the major health problem especially in elderly people. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is released from urinary bladder cells and acts as a smooth muscle contraction and sensory signal in micturition but little is known about the role of ATP release in the pathophysiology of overactive bladder. To assess the relationship between ATP and overactive bladder, we used a partial bladder outlet obstruction (pBOO) model in rats. The bladder caused several changes by pBOO: An increase in bladder weight, hypertrophy of sub-urothelium and sub-serosal area, and frequent non - voiding bladder contraction during urine storage. Basal ATP release from urothelium and serosa of pBOO rats was significantly higher than that of normal rats. Distention induced ATP release from urothelium of normal and pBOO rats had no significant change. However, distention - induced ATP release from serosa of pBOO rats was higher than that of normal. These findings may identify ATP especially released from serosa as one of causes of non - voiding contractions and overactive bladder symptoms.
