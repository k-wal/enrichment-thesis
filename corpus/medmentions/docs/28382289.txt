28382289|a|Single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has become a more frequently performed method for benign gallbladder diseases all over the world. The effects of SILC technique on oxidative stress have not been well documented. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of laparoscopic cholecystectomy techniques on systemic oxidative stress by using ischemia modified albumin (IMA). In total, 70 patients who had been diagnosed with benign gallbladder pathology were enrolled for this prospective study. Twenty-one patients underwent SILC and 49 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). All operations were performed under a standard anesthesia protocol. Serum IMA levels were analysed before operation, 45 minutes and 24 hours after operation. Demographics and preoperative characteristics of the patients were similiar in each group. The mean duration of operation was 37.5 ± 12.5 and 44.6 ± 14.3 minutes in LC and SILC group, respectively. In both groups, there was no statistically significant difference in hospital stay, operative time, or conversion to open surgery. Operative technique did not effect the 45th minute and 24th hour IMA levels. However, prolonged operative time (>30 minutes) caused an early increase in the level of IMA. Twenty-fourth hour IMA levels were not different. SILC is an effective and safe surgical prosedure for benign gallbladder diseases. Independent of the surgical technique for cholecystectomy, the prolonged operative time could increase the tissue ischemia.
