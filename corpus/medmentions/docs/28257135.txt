28257135|t|The value of lacrimal scintillography in the assessment of patients with epiphora
28257135|a|PurposeTo assess the influence of dacryoscintillography (DSG) on the treatment decision for patients with epiphora and clinically patent non-functioning lacrimal systems .MethodsA retrospective 3-year review. Inclusion: patients having DSG for epiphora with delayed tear clearance, lacrimal system patency on syringing, and no visible external cause for watering. On the basis of regurgitation during syringing, tear ducts were divided into freely patent (FP â‰¤20%) or stenosed. The DSG results were examined for correlation with symptoms and clinical examination, the influence on decision to proceed to dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR), and the ability to predict the surgical outcome .ResultsA total of 242 eyes were examined. The clinical diagnosis was FP in 45.5%, nasolacrimal duct stenosis (NLDS) in 26.4%, and other in 3.3%. The DSG was normal in 30.9% of FP and 18.7% of NLDS eyes. Of the asymptomatic eyes, 46.7% had an abnormal DSG. DSG sensitivity was 73.6% and specificity 53.3%. There was no significant difference in DSG results in those with FP or NLDS. DCR was recommended in 39.1% of the symptomatic eyes with abnormal DSG. DCR surgery was considered inappropriate in all 46 eyes with normal DSG. DCR was successful in 76.5%, however, the DSG result did not affect the success of surgery .Conclusion DSG has severe limitations due to lack of correlation with symptoms and clinical examination, inability to separate lacrimal duct narrowing from lacrimal pump function, and inability to predict the results of surgery. DSG can at best provide limited guidance on whether to proceed to DCR surgery .Eye advance online publication, 3 March 2017; doi:10.1038/eye.2017.20.
