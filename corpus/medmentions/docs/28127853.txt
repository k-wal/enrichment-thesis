28127853|t|Creative approach for successful aging: A pilot study of an intergenerational health promotion program
28127853|a|To develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an intergenerational health promotion program. This was an action research project. A total of 34 participants attended the 12- week program and completed the pre-test and post-test. There were 16 middle-aged and nine older adults recruited from a district of Taipei, and nine young adults recruited from the principal investigator's university. The " Attitudes toward Aging Scale " and the " Spiritual Health Scale " were two assessment instruments used in the study. The results showed that there were significant improvements in the Attitudes toward Aging Scale for the young adult group (aged 18-29 years) and in the Spiritual Health Scale for the older adult group (aged 65-80 years). The evaluation showed that participants were satisfied with the program. The results of the present study provide future directions for successful aging and intergenerational learning.
