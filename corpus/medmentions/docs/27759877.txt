27759877|a|We read the report by Çeltikçi et al in the Turkish Neurosurgery with great interest. In this single-center retrospective study, they analysed 449 intracranial meningioma patients underwent open surgery. They stated that venous thromboembolism (VTE) had been seen in 21 (4.6%) of their patients. This is an important issue because VTE, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), is the most common overall complication in meningioma surgery and is fatal in up to one third of patients (2). We suppose that prophylaxis of VTE is most effective when mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis are combined. We consider that there key some practical questions to be answered for a proper clinical extrapolation.
