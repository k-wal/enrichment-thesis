28118200|t|Clinical Observation of Treatment of Chronic Subdural Hematoma With Novel Double Needle Minimally Invasive Aspiration Technology
28118200|a|The aim of the present study was to explore the clinical effects, including the prevention of complications, of the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma with double needle aspiration. The clinical data of 31 patients with chronic subdural hematoma treated by double YL-1 needle double skull drilling and 31 controls treated by traditional drilling and drainage were analyzed retrospectively. In the YL-1 needle group, only 1 patient was with hematoma recurrence, 1 patient was with intracranial pneumocephalus, and the remaining patients who were followed up for 3 months achieved a clinical cure. In the traditional drilling and drainage group, 13 patients were with hematoma recurrence within 3 months after the operation and 7 patients were with postoperative intracranial pneumocephalus. The method of double YL-1 needle is better than the traditional drilling and drainage method for the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma because it reduces the postoperative recurrence rate and complications.
