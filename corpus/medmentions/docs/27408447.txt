27408447|t|Slow-Growing Large Irritation Fibroma of the Anterior Hard Palate: A Case Report Using Immunohistochemical Analysis
27408447|a|Irritation fibromas are recognized as fibrous lesions, usually reactive hyperplasias; however, the mechanism of enlargement is unclear. This paper reports on an abnormally large irritation fibroma of extremely gradual growth. The immunohistochemical features (CD34, α-SMA, vimentin, Ki-67, and TGF-α) of this irritation fibroma are presented to distinguish reactive hyperplasia from other true fibrous neoplasm diseases. In the only previous study, it was reported that the expression of TGF-α might be associated with the development of oral fibromas. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between this exceptionally-large fibrous lesion of extremely slow growth and the immunohistochemical reactivity of TGF-α, finding that, in contrast to the previous study, TGF-α was not expressed. This is the first study to evaluate the enlargement mechanism of such a large irritation fibroma using the approach of immunohistochemical analysis, and it indicates that such analysis can help elucidate the diverse causes and enlargement mechanisms of irritation fibromas.
