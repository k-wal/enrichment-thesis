28482033|a|Since survival after postoperative non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) recurrence is extremely poor, the long-term post - recurrence outcomes are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term post - recurrence outcomes and clarify who are possibly ' cured ' in recent clinical practice. We reviewed the medical records of 635 patients who developed postoperative recurrence until 2012 after R0 resection for pathological Stage IA-IIIA NSCLC between 1993 and 2006. Factors associated with post - recurrence surviva l (PRS) and the characteristics of the long-term (â‰¥5 years) survivors were analysed retrospectively. The 5- year PRS rate of all 635 patients was 13%. Multivariable analysis revealed that female [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78], adenocarcinoma (HR = 0.77), locoregional (only) recurrence (HR = 0.59) and longer recurrence -free survival (HR = 0.99) were favourably associated with PRS. A total of 51 patients achieved 5- year PRS; however, 32 (63%) were cancer -bearing patients in their fifth post-recurrent year who were mainly treated by epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). Subsequent PRS curves for cancer - controlled and cancer -bearing groups were different (8- year PRS: 94% vs 31%, P = 0.003). Among 19 cancer - controlled patients in their fifth post-recurrent year, 17 (89%) patients initially received radical local therapy for their recurrence. Two-thirds of 5- year survivors after postoperative NSCLC recurrence had a cancer -bearing status and showed deteriorated subsequent survival. Curability of postoperative NSCLC recurrence should be evaluated in terms of the ' cancer - controlled ' status, and ' cured ' population is included in the patients who are ' cancer controlled ' at the fifth post-recurrent year.
