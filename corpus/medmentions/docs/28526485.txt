28526485|t|Improving the Sexual Health of Young People With Mobility Impairments: Challenges and Recommendations
28526485|a|This mixed-method study (a) describes challenges to providing sexual health services to youth with mobility impairments from the perspective of health care providers and experts and (b) describes and compares sexual health -related experiences of youth with mobility impairments. Secondary data analysis of My Path, a study focused on the transition to adulthood for youth with mobility impairments. Using an exploratory sequential design, qualitative data (n = 10) were analyzed using systematic content analysis followed by quantitative analysis of survey data (N = 337). Challenges included not talking about sex, managing sexual development, adaptation and instruction, parent roles, and safety. Survey data showed that youth with mobility impairments are diverse in their experiences with sexual behavior and sources of sexual health information. Although connected with primary care providers, few received information about sexual health. Interventions to improve youths ' well-being should include comprehensive care and education that promotes and supports healthy sexual development.
