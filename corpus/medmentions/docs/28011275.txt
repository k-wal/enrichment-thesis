28011275|t|Perioperative Transfusion of Leukocyte - depleted Blood Products in Contemporary Radical Cystectomy Cohort Does Not Adversely Impact Short-term Survival
28011275|a|To evaluate the effect of leukoreduced -only perioperative blood transfusion (PBT) and corresponding survival outcomes in a radical cystectomy cohort of patients. We analyzed data from 1026 patients who underwent radical cystectomy at our institution. PBT was defined as transfusion in the intraoperative or within the postoperative hospitalization period. Multivariable analyses using Cox proportional hazards were performed to measure the association between PBT, patient variables, and 3 primary end points: recurrence-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival. Kaplan-Meier curves estimated survival times and were compared with log-rank test. Overall, of a total of 1026 patients, 341 (33.2%) received leukoreduced PBT. The median follow-up was 27.5 months. Transfused patients were more likely to be female, had higher estimated blood loss, lower preoperative hemoglobin, were more likely to have received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or had undergone a continent urinary diversion. Higher pathologic tumor and nodal stage were observed more frequently in patients who received PBT. On multivariable analysis, PBT was not associated with worse recurrence-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival (all P > .05). Kaplan-Meier curves did not show any significant differences (all P > .05) between the transfused and nontransfused groups. In addition, no differences were found in regard to timing of transfusion, that is, intraoperative vs postoperative, in distinct analysis. No significant association was found between leukoreduced PBT and worse survival outcomes at short-term follow-up in a contemporary cohort of cystectomy patients. Prospective long-term follow-up is warranted.
