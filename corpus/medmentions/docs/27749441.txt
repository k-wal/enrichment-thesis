27749441|t|Daily Use of a Facial Broad Spectrum Sunscreen Over One- Year Significantly Improves Clinical Evaluation of Photoaging
27749441|a|Sunscreens are known to protect from sun damage; however, their effects on the reversal of photodamage have been minimally investigated. The aim of the prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of a facial sun protection factor (SPF) 30 formulation for the improvement of photodamage during a 1- year use. Thirty-two subjects applied a broad spectrum photostable sunscreen (SPF 30) for 52 weeks to the entire face. Assessments were conducted through dermatologist evaluations and subjects ' self-assessment at baseline and then at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52. Clinical evaluations showed that all photoaging parameters improved significantly from baseline as early as Week 12 and the amelioration continued until Week 52. Skin texture, clarity, and mottled and discrete pigmentation were the most improved parameters by the end of the study (40% to 52% improvement from baseline), with 100% of subjects showing improvement in skin clarity and texture. The daily use of a facial broad-spectrum photostable sunscreen may visibly reverse the signs of existing photodamage, in addition to preventing additional sun damage.
