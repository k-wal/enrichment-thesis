This review considers the current state of play with respect to what is known about the underlying pathogenesis of these two chronic inflammatory diseases of the lung. The review highlights why they are different conditions requiring different approaches to treatment and provides a backdrop for the subsequent chapters in this volume discussing recent advances in the pharmacology and treatment of asthma and COPD.
