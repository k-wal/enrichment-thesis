28429412|t|Bone extracellular matrix hydrogel enhances osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts and mouse primary calvarial cells
28429412|a|Hydrogel scaffolds derived from the extracellular matrix (ECM) of mammalian tissues have been successfully used to promote tissue repair in vitro and in vivo. The objective of this study was to evaluate the osteogenic potential of ECM hydrogels prepared from demineralized and decellularized bovine bone in the presence and absence of osteogenic medium. Culture of C2C12 and mouse primary calvarial cells (mPCs) on decellularized bone ECM (bECM) and demineralized bone matrix (DBM) gels resulted in increased expression of osteogenic gene markers, including a 3.6- and 13.4-fold increase in osteopontin and 15.7- and 27.1-fold increase in osteocalcin when mPCs were cultured upon bECM with basal and osteogenic media, respectively. bECM hydrogels stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 and mPCs even in the absence of osteogenic medium. These results suggest that bECM hydrogel scaffolds may have great utility in future clinical applications for bone tissue engineering. Â© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
