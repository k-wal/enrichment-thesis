27450789|t|Differences in pain experience and cooperation between consecutive surgeries in patients undergoing phacoemulsification
27450789|a|The purpose of this study is to compare pain experience and cooperation between consecutive surgeries in patients undergoing phacoemulsification in both eyes, using sub-Tenon's local anesthesia without sedation. In this study, 268 patients with bilateral senile cataracts were recruited. All operations were performed without sedation, using a clear corneal phacoemulsification technique and sub-Tenon's local anesthesia, by one of four surgeons. The first surgery was performed on the eye with the higher grade cataract. The other eye was operated on within 3 months by the same surgeon (mean interval 1.9 ± 1.1 months). All patients were asked to grade their pain experience during induction and maintenance of anesthesia and also during the phacoemulsification surgery, using a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain) administered after the surgery. The cooperation of the patient was graded from 0 (no event) to 3 (markedeye and head movement and lid squeezing) by the attending surgeon. The VAS scores and cooperation scores of the patients were the outcome measurements. The mean pain score was 2.11 ± 0.79 in the first eye and 3.33 ± 0.80 in the second eye during the administration of sub-Tenon's anesthesia, and 1.50 ± 0.60 in the first eye and 2.10 ± 0.57 in the second eye during the phacoemulsification surgery. The patient cooperation score was 1.60 ± 0.75 in the first surgery and 2.08 ± 0.72 in the second surgery. The differences between the first and second surgeries were statistically significant for all outcome measures (p < 0.01). Patients who previously underwent phaco surgery in one eye experienced more pain and showed worse cooperation during the phaco surgery in the second eye, especially if there was a short time between the surgeries, viz., less than 3 months. Therefore, if the surgeon has difficulty in the first operation gaining the patient's cooperation, the surgeon must be careful: if contralateral eye surgery is required, the addition of sedation / analgesia should be considered or the surgery postponed for a while to abolish the influence of recent memory on the patient's subsequent pain experience.
