28549399|t|A systematic review investigating psychosocial aspects of egg sharing in the United Kingdom and their potential effects on egg donation numbers
28549399|a|This review aims to provide an up-to-date knowledge of the psychosocial aspects of egg donation from the perspectives of the egg share donor and their recipient. It explores the motives, experiences and attitudes of egg sharers and their views towards donor anonymity and disclosure. Conclusions are made on how these findings can guide clinical practice and improve egg sharing numbers. A systematic search of peer-reviewed journals of four computerized databases was undertaken. Eleven studies were included in the review. Psychosocial aspects towards donation were positive from the egg share donor and recipient. Concerns raised were whether participating in the egg sharing scheme would impact on their success rates, as well as frustration expressed by a minority regarding the lack of knowledge of egg sharing outside of fertility clinics. The 2005 legislative changes in the UK have not caused the anticipated dramatic decrease in egg donation; however, oocyte donation still falls short of demand. Egg sharing provides a practical option for more patients to access IVF, whilst also providing more donor oocytes. Improved information provision will result in greater awareness of egg sharing, with the potential to recruit more donors and meet the needs of recipients currently on long waiting lists.
