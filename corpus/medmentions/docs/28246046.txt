28246046|t|A comparison of minimally invasive approach vs conventional approach for volar plating of distal radial fractures
28246046|a|The aim of this study was to introduce and to evaluate the functional results of volar plating of distal radial fractures through a longitudinal minimally invasive approach. From January 2010 to January 2013, 157 patients with distal radial fractures were randomly allocated to group A (n = 83; 49 men, 34 women; mean age: 42 (18-67)) and B (n = 74; 46 men, 28 women; mean age: 41 (22-65)), including type A2, A3, B3, C1, and C2 fractures, based on AO Foundation and Orthopaedic Trauma Association Classification. Patients in group A were treated through a 1.5- to 2-cm longitudinal incision, and patients in group B were treated through the conventional flexor carpi radialis approach. All fractures were treated with a locking volar plate. The functional results were compared with range of motion, grip and pronation strengths for each fracture type. After a follow-up of 2 years, similar measurements were noted on range of motion and grip strength in both groups. Regarding pronation strength, group A was superior to group B (p < 0.05). Minimally invasive volar plating of distal radial fractures is a safe and reliable technique, resulting in better pronation function and appearance.
