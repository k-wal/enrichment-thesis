28276842|t|Different views on treatment decisions by first-year interprofessional healthcare students
28276842|a|This study explored ethical treatment decisions of healthcare professional students beginning their education. As part of a first-semester modern medicine and bioethics course, 311 students watched and discussed, in interprofessional groups, a video titled Dax's Case: Who Should Decide? regarding the treatment of a life-threatening infectious disease against Dax's wish. The students then discussed and made their decision regarding treating or not. Their decisions, recorded on a worksheet, were classified as " will treat " or " won't treat ." Professional groups ' decision patterns were compared using the chi-square test. Overall, 151 (71%) opinions from students were classified as " will treat ," and 61 (29%) as " won't treat ." Nursing students were more likely to decide " won't treat " (in line with Dax's preference); however, the majority of other professions ' students favoured treatment (against Dax's wish). Given the students ' limited exposure to profession -specific education, our preliminary study supports the notion that healthcare profession students hold different values that align with their chosen profession at the start of their studies.
