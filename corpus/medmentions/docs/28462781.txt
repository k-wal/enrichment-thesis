28462781|t|A new approach to nasomaxillary complex type of nasal bone fracture: Clip operation
28462781|a|Nasal bone fractures comprise almost 40% of all facial injuries. Most are initially reduced using closed reduction. This study introduces a newly developed method, the clip operation via endonasal approach. The operation was performed in these patients by a single surgeon extensively experienced in facial bone fractures. An absorbable mesh plate made into a clip was used for fixation after open reduction via the endonasal approach. No screws were used for fixation. Nasal packing was removed the first day after surgery; aluminum splinting was removed the third week after surgery. Three-dimensional facial computed tomography and cephalolateral radiography were performed preoperatively and postoperatively. Plastic surgeon satisfaction and postoperative complications were assessed. Fracture relapse was not observed. Reduction status was well maintained. Postoperative complications occurred, with a low final incidence of 1.8% in the third postoperative month. Plastic surgeon satisfaction was very high at 4.58. This operation takes 5-10 min, and is simple to perform. It entails a short hospitalization, and the duration during which nasal packing and aluminum splint are maintained is comparable. Undesirable functional, aesthetic complications and secondary surgery resulting from inaccurate relapse were reduced. The clip operation is a useful technique for correcting nasal bone fractures, especially nasomaxillary complex type.
