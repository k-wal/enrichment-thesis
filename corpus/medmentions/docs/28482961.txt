28482961|a|An urban demographic surveillance site in Bissau, the capital of Guinea-Bissau, West Africa .BACKGROUND We hypothesised that if previous malnutrition plays a part in acquiring active tuberculosis (TB) disease, households of TB cases would have a higher prevalence of malnutrition than those of healthy controls. A cross-sectional study comparing nutritional and socio-economic status of all newly diagnosed patients with TB in 2014 with household contacts (persons residing in the household of TB cases) and random controls. Exclusion criteria were extra-pulmonary TB, age <15 years and pregnancy. Prevalence of malnutrition was 5% in household contacts and healthy controls, and 51% in patients with TB. Patients with TB had 22% (95%CI 19-25) lower body weight, 22% (95%CI 20-25) lower body mass index and 22% (95%CI 19-24) lower mid-upper arm circumference than healthy controls (P < 0.001); household contacts and healthy controls were comparable for all measures. The socio-economic status of households with TB cases was lower. We did not find a higher prevalence of malnourishment in households with TB cases. This finding did not support the hypothesis that malnourishment was an important causative factor for the development of active TB among patients in this study.
