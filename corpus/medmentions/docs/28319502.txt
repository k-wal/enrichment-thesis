28319502|a|Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) is a rare condition in the elderly and can appear as a first presentation of various types of rheumatic and malignant diseases. We presented a 62- year -old man with the diagnosis of RS3PE based on the clinical sign and laboratory data. Because of the possibility of associated malignancies in RS3PE, FDG PET/CT was performed to exclude occult tumors. The images showed multiple, symmetrically, diffusely increased F-FDG uptake in the soft tissue around joints and bones in the shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles.
