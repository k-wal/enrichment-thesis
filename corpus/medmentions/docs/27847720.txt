27847720|t|Dilemmas of Korean Athletes With a Spinal Cord Injury to Participate in Sports: A Survey Based on the ICF Core Set for Spinal Cord Injury
27847720|a|To explore the experiences of athletes with spinal cord injury (SCI) in Korea with respect to dilemmas of participating in sports with regards to the facilitators and barriers, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). The facilitators and barriers to sports participation of individuals with SCI were examined using 112 ICF categories. A questionnaire in dichotomous scale was answered, which covered the subjects ' Body functions ', ' Body structures ', ' Activity and participation ' and ' Environmental factors '. Data analysis included the use of descriptive statistics to examine the frequency and magnitude of reported issues. Sixty-two community-dwelling participants were recruited. Frequently addressed barriers in ' Body functions ' were mobility related problems such as muscle and joint problems, bladder and bowel function s, pressure ulcers, and pain. In ' Activity and participation ', most frequently reported were mobility and self-care problems. Highly addressed barriers in ' Environmental factors ' were sports facilities, financial cost, transportation problems and lack of information. Relationships such as peer, family and friends were the most important facilitators. Numerous barriers still exist for SCI survivors to participate in sports, especially in the area of health care needs and environmental factors. Our results support the need for a multidisciplinary approach to promote sports participation.
