28385938|a|The purposes of this study were to clarify first, the incidence of peroneal tendon dislocation in patients with a fracture of the talus and second the factors associated with peroneal tendon dislocation. We retrospectively examined 30 patients (30 ankles) with a mean age of 37.5 years, who had undergone internal fixation for a fracture of the talus. Independent examiners assessed for peroneal tendon dislocation using the pre-operative CT images. The medical records were also reviewed for the presence of peroneal tendon dislocation. The associations between the presence of dislocation with the patient characteristics or radiological findings, including age, mechanism of injury, severity of fracture, and fleck sign, were assessed using Fisher's exact tests. The pre-operative CT images showed peroneal tendon dislocation in eight out of 30 patients. Dislocation was found later in one patient whose pre-operative CT image had not shown dislocation. The overall incidence of peroneal tendon dislocation was 30% (9/30). The presence of dislocation was associated with the presence of a fleck sign (p = 0.03). Surprisingly, approximately one-third of the patients who underwent internal fixation for a fracture of the talus had peroneal tendon dislocation. This was associated with a fleck sign.
