28424384|a|The increased prevalence of minor physical anomalies (MPAs) and the abnormalities of dermatoglyphic patterns may be physical manifestations of neurodevelopmental disruption in affective disorders. This paper aims to review the current state of knowledge on the frequency of MPAs and dermatoglyphic abnormalities in mood disorders. A MEDLINE, PsychInfo and Web of Science search was carried out to collect all publications on the frequency of MPAs and on dermatoglyphic traits in bipolar disorder and unipolar depression. 24 studies on MPAs, 19 on dermatoglyphics, and 5 dealing with both were found with discrepant findings. The relative contribution of neurodevelopmental retardation to the aetiology of affective disorders remains undetermined, the field is open for further research. Increased recognition of neurodevelopmental processes in the origin of affective disorders may allow for earlier and more effective intervention and prevention.
