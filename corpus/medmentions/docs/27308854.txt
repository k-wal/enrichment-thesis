27308854|t|Maternal vitamin D levels and the risk of perinatal death
27308854|a|To determine the association between maternal vitamin D levels and perinatal death. A retrospective cross-sectional study of all non-anomalous, singleton births (â‰¥24 weeks) with perinatal death compared to a matched control group. Only pregnancies with a recorded vitamin D level at booking (8-19 weeks gestation) were included for analysis. Maternal vitamin D levels were categorized into normal, deficient and insufficient cohorts and variables compared between the three groups. There were 31 perinatal deaths which were compared to 111 controls. Median vitamin D levels were lower in the perinatal death cohort compared to the control group (55 nmol/L versus 64 nmol/L, p = 0.43). There was no significant increase in deaths between the normal and deficient (p = 0.33) or insufficient (p = 0.09) groups. Low maternal vitamin D levels at booking were not associated with an increased risk of perinatal demise.
