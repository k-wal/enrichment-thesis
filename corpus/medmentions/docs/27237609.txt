27237609|a|Dietary antioxidants may play an important role in the prevention of bone loss and associated fractures by reducing levels of oxidative stress. We prospectively investigated the association between dietary Non Enzymatic Antioxidant Capacity (NEAC) and the risk of hip fracture and whether this effect was modified by smoking. In the Swedish National March Cohort 13,409 men and women over the age of 55 who had not experienced cancer, cardiovascular disease or hip fracture, were followed through record-linkages from 1997 through 2010. NEAC was assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire collected at baseline. We categorized the distribution of NEAC into sex - specific quartiles and used multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). During a mean follow-up time of 12.4years, we identified 491 incident cases of first hip fracture. Subjects in the highest quartile of dietary NEAC had a 39% lower risk of incident hip fracture compared to those in the lowest quartile (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.44-0.85). The association was non-linear (p for non-linearity: 0.004) with a potential threshold between the first and the second quartile and no further risk reduction at higher levels of dietary NEAC. Due to a low smoking prevalence in our study population, we had limited power to detect effect modification between dietary NEAC and smoking on a multiplicative or additive scale. Higher dietary NEAC intake is associated with lower risk of hip fracture in the elderly.
