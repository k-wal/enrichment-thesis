28222314|t|Systematic variation of the benzenesulfonamide part of the GluN2A selective NMDA receptor antagonist TCN-201
28222314|a|GluN2A subunit containing N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are highly involved in various physiological processes in the central nervous system, but also in some diseases, such as anxiety, depression and schizophrenia. However, the role of GluN2A subunit containing NMDARs in pathological processes is not exactly elucidated. In order to obtain potent and selective inhibitors of GluN2A subunit containing NMDARs, the selective negative allosteric modulator 2 was systematically modified at the benzenesulfonamide part. The activity of the test compounds was recorded in two electrode voltage clamp experiments using Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing exclusively NMDARs with GluN1a and GluN2A subunits. It was found that halogen atoms in 3-position of the benzenesulfonamide part result in high GluN2A antagonistic activity. With an IC50 value of 204 nM the 3-bromo derivative 5i (N-{4-[(2-benzoylhydrazino)carbonyl]benzyl}-3-bromobenzenesulfonamide) has 2.5-fold higher antagonistic activity than the lead compound 2 and represents our new lead compound.
