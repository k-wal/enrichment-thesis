27920399|a|The elderly with atrial fibrillation are more prone to stroke. Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin are effective in the prevention of atrial fibrillation -associated stroke and systemic embolism. The CHADS2 or CHA2D2-VASc score and HAS-BLED score were developed to stratify stroke risk associated with atrial fibrillation and bleeding risk in a patient with atrial fibrillation, respectively, to facilitate the decision for and safe use of oral anticoagulant. Nonetheless, the decision for anticoagulation is not straightforward and the elderly with non-valvular atrial fibrillation are often precluded from anticoagulant prescription. Advanced age and disadvantages associated with the elderly such as fall, comorbidities, cognitive impairment, and polypharmacy contribute to the over-concern of physicians about bleeding risk. Various treatment options such as low-intensity warfarin and aspirin plus clopidogrel have been suggested but are inferior to dose-adjusted warfarin. Novel oral anticoagulants with promising efficacy and convenience hold great appeal. Optimal management of underlying medical conditions and modifiable stroke risk factors, together with intervention to improve the safe use of oral anticoagulants, are useful.
