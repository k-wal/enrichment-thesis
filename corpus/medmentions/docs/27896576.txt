27896576|t|Comparing the bulking effect of calcium hydroxyapatite and Deflux injection into the bladder neck for improvement of urinary incontinence in bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex
27896576|a|The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the endoscopic injection of calcium hydroxyapatite (CaHA) into the bladder neck (BN) region of patients with urinary incontinence and bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). We designed a retrospective cohort study in which we retrospectively studied medical charts of female and male patients of BEEC who had undergone CaHA or Deflux injection for continence improvement between 2009 and 2014. Sixteen incontinent patients with a mean ± SD age of 8.09 ± 3.5 years received an endoscopic submucosal injection of 5.4 ml of pure CaHA powder with autologous plasma (group A). Patients in group B (N = 21), control group, with a mean ± SD age of 7.51 ± 2.8 years received Deflux injection (5.1 ml). The mean follow-up after injection was 38 ± 5.2 and 33 ± 4.1 months in groups A and B, respectively. No post-injection complication was detected in none of the patients during the follow-up. Eleven patients (68.75%) in group A became socially dry following 1-2 injections, the degree of incontinence was improved in 4 patients (25%), and there was no change in one patient (6.25%). However, Deflux injection resulted in complete dryness in 14 (66.66%), improvement in the degree of incontinence in 5 (23.81%) and no change in 2 patients (9.52%), leading to no significant difference in continence achievement between CaHA and Deflux groups (p = 0.9). The statistical analysis was not significantly different in terms of bladder capacity (p = 0.7) or Q max (p = 0.8). The preliminary results of this study revealed that CaHA may be applied as an affordable bulking agent in treatment of urinary incontinence in BEEC.
