28281972|t|A Randomized Controlled Open-Label Pilot Study of Simvastatin Addition to Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy in Patients With Brain Metastases
28281972|a|Statins have been reported to have a potential radiosensitizing effect that has not been evaluated in clinical trials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of simvastatin in addition to whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in patients with brain metastases (BM). A prospective randomized, controlled, open-label pilot study was conducted on 50 Egyptian patients with BM who were randomly assigned to receive 30-Gy WBRT (control group: 25 patients) or 30 Gy WBRT + simvastatin 80 mg/day for the WBRT period (simvastatin group: 25 patients). The primary outcome was radiological response at 4 weeks after WBRT. Secondary outcomes were 1-year progression-free survival (PFS), 1-year overall survival (OS), and health-related quality of life (HRQL) that was assessed using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and its brain module (BN-20), at baseline, after WBRT, and 4 weeks after WBRT. The addition of simvastatin was tolerated. Twenty-one patients were not evaluated for radiological response because of death (n = 16), noncompliance to follow-up (n = 4), and clinical deterioration (n = 1). Response rates were 60% and 78.6% (p = 0.427), 1-year PFS rates were 5.2% and 17.7% (p = 0.392), and 1-year OS rates were 12% and 8% (p = 0.880) for the control group and simvastatin group, respectively. Nonsignificant differences were found between the two arms regarding HRQL scales. The addition of simvastatin 80 mg/day did not improve the clinical outcomes of patients with BM receiving WBRT.
