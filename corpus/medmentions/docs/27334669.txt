27334669|t|Self-assembled polymeric vectors mixtures: characterization of the polymorphism and existence of synergistic effects in photodynamic therapy
27334669|a|The objective of this work was to assess the relation between the purity of polymeric self-assemblies vectors solution and their photodynamic therapeutic efficiency. For this, several amphiphilic block copolymers of poly(ethyleneoxide-b-ε-caprolactone) have been used to form self-assemblies with different morphologies (micelles, worm-like micelles or vesicles). In a first step, controlled mixtures of preformed micelles and vesicles have been characterized both by dynamic light scattering and asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation (AsFlFFF). For this, a custom-made program, STORMS, was developed to analyze DLS data in a thorough manner by providing a large set of fitting parameters. This showed that DLS only sensed the larger vesicles when the micelles / vesicles ratio was 80/20 w/w. On the other hand, AsFlFFF allowed clear detection of the presence of micelles when this same ratio was as low as 10/90. Subsequently, the photodynamic therapy efficiency of various controlled mixtures was assessed using multicellular spheroids when a photosensitizer, pheophorbide a, was encapsulated in the polymer self-assemblies. Some mixtures were shown to be as efficient as monomorphous systems. In some cases, mixtures were found to exhibit a higher PDT efficiency compared to the individual nano - objects, revealing a synergistic effect for the efficient delivery of the photosensitizer. Polymorphous vectors can therefore be superior in therapeutic applications.
