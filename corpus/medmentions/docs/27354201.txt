27354201|t|Function analysis of Mef2c promoter in muscle differentiation
27354201|a|Regeneration of adult skeletal muscle following injury occurs through the activation of satellite cells, that proliferates, differentiates, and fuses with injured myofibers. Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) proteins are reported that they have the potential contributions to adult muscle regeneration. In order to further understand Mef2c gene, the promoter of pig Mef2c gene was analyzed in this paper. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed the expression pattern of Mef2c gene in muscle of eight tissues. The Mef2c promoter had the higher transcriptional activity in differentiated C2C12 cells than that in proliferating C2C12 cells, which was accompanied by the up-regulation of mRNA expression of Mef2c gene. Function deletion and mutation analyses showed that MyoD and MEF2 binding sites within the Mef2c promoter were responsible for the regulation of Mef2c transcription. MEF2C could up-regulate the transcriptional activities of Mef2c promoter constructs which contained a 3'-end nucleotide sequence with p300 binding site. The Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays determined the MyoD binding site in Mef2c promoter. These results advanced our knowledge of the promoter of the pig Mef2c gene. And the study of Mef2c promoter regulator elements helped to elucidating the regulation mechanisms of Mef2c in muscle differentiation or muscle repair and regeneration.
