27270753|a|The bactericidal activity (MIC-test) of Ocimum americanum (inflorescences) essential oil (OAEO) against Aeromonas hydrophila was determined in this study. It was also investigated the potential of OAEO and the main compound found in the oil (linalool) at subinhibitory concentrations to be inhibitors of hemolysis caused by Aer. hydrophila in fish erythrocytes. An in vivo experiment was conducted to evaluate survival of fish (Rhamdia quelen) experimentally infected with Aer. hydrophila and exposed to OAEO. A second experiment was conducted to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo activity of OAEO (mix from inflorescences and leaves) against the parasite Gyrodactylus sp. The OAEO showed weak in vitro activity against Aer. hydrophila (6400 μg ml(-1)). At subinhibitory concentrations OAEO (100 μg ml(-1)) inhibited hemolysis (90%) caused by Aer. hydrophila in fish erythrocytes, however, linalool did not present hemolysis inhibition activity. At low concentrations (10 and 20 mg l(-1)) added to the water OAEO promoted survival of experimentally infected fish with Aer. hydrophila. Lastly, OAEO -mix (50 mg l(-1)) was effective against Gyrodactylus sp. significantly reducing (60%) the number of parasites in the fish. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.
