27694287|t|Understanding Supportive Care Factors Among African American Breast Cancer Survivors
27694287|a|Comprehensive breast cancer care includes not only diagnosis, staging, and treatment of cancer but also assessment and management of the physical, psychological, social, and informational needs, collectively known as supportive care. Several studies have documented the importance of addressing supportive care factors among breast cancer survivors. However, there appears to be a paucity of research concerning African American breast cancer survivors (AABCS). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to describe and understand the patient-centered supportive care factors among self-identified AABCS. Using a qualitative descriptive approach, an open-ended question explored supportive care factors that were used by N = 155 AABCS. Four supportive care factors were identified: faith, supportive structures, optimism, and access to information. An understanding of these factors might facilitate discussion between survivors and the health care team. The resultant effect could also inform and promote the delivery of culturally specific health care to address the supportive care needs among these women.
