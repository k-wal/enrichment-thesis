28457384|a|Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is a well-recognized complication of liver transplantation (LT). HAT is an important risk factor for infectious, in particular hepatic abscess, which can cause graft loss and increasing morbidity and mortality. We present a case report of complicated LT in a 52- year-old Caucasian man with primary sclerosing cholangitis. In 2007 the patient was included on the waiting list in Padua for LT. In 2012 the patient underwent percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage for bile duct stricture, complicated with acute pancreatitis. A diagnostic laparoscopy was performed with choledochotomy and Kehr's T tube drainage. On February 14, 2012, the patient underwent LT with arterial reconstruction and choledochojejunostomy. The postoperative course was complicated with HAT, multiple liver abscesses, and sepsis associated with bacteremia due to Enterococcus faecium despite massive intravenous antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainages. On November 28, 2012, the patient underwent retransplantation. Four years after transplantation the patient is still in good general condition. Hepatic abscess formation secondary to HAT following LT is a major complication associated with important morbidity and mortality. In selected cases retransplantation should be considered as our case demonstrates.
