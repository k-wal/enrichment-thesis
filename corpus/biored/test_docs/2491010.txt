2491010|t|Molecular and phenotypic analysis of patients with deletions within the deletion-rich region of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene.
2491010|a|Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the DMD locus. This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9. These 80 individuals account for approximately 75% of 109 deletions of the gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA. Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper). Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Of these, eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions. This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al. and Koenig et al. but is in contrast to findings, by Malhotra et al. at the 5 ' end of the gene.
