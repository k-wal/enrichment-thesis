6,"In order to explain the reduced genetic heterogeneity detected by Alu insertions among Basque subpopulations , values of the Wright 's F(ST ) statistic were estimated for both Alu markers and a set of short tandem repeats ( STRs ) in terms of two geographical scales : ( 1 ) the Basque Country , ( 2 ) Europe ( including Basques ) .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

9,"From these results , we suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of the Basque gene pool identified in previous polymorphism studies is relatively recent and probably caused by a differential process of genetic admixture with non - Basque neighboring populations modulated by the effect of a linguistic barrier to random mating .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
