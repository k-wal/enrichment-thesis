1474,the production of hydrogen containing very low levels of carbon monoxide for use in polymer electrolyte fuel cells requires the development of catalysts that show very high activity at low temperatures where the equilibrium for the removal of carbon monoxide using the water – gas shift reaction is favourable .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,I,I,I,I,O,O,O"
1475,it has been claimed that oxide - supported gold catalysts have the required high activity but there is considerable uncertainty in the literature about the feasibility of using these catalysts under real conditions .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,B,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
1476,by comparing the activity of gold catalysts with that of platinum catalysts it is shown that well - prepared gold catalysts are significantly more active than the corresponding platinum catalysts .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,B,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

1480,this close contact between small metallic gold particles and the support may result in the “ atoms ” at the point of contact having a net charge ( most probably cationic ) but the high activity is associated with the presence of metallic gold .,"O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,B,O"

1484,these may be important for CO oxidation but the fact that water has to be activated in the water gas shift reaction may point towards a more dominant role for the interfacial sites .,"O,O,O,O,O,B,I,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"

1487,"In this , it is proposed that the dominant surface intermediate is a function of reaction conditions .","O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O,O"
